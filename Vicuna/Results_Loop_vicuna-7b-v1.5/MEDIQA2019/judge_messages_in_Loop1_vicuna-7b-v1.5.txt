Edward's syndrome, or trisomy 18, is a relatively rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in every 5,000 to 20,000 live births.", "2. 'It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 18 in the body cells.'- This statement is true. Edward's syndrome occurs due to the presence of an additional copy of chromosome 18 in the cells of the body.", "3. 'This extra copy can lead to a variety of physical and developmental problems, including heart defects, kidney abnormalities, and intellectual disability.'- This statement is true. The presence of an extra copy of chromosome 18 can indeed result in a range of physical and developmental issues, such as heart defects, kidney abnormalities, and intellectual disability.", "4. 'Diagnosis of Edward's syndrome typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and genetic testing.'- This statement is true. The diagnosis of Edward's syndrome usually requires a comprehensive approach that includes a physical examination, review of medical history, and genetic testing.", "5. 'During the physical examination, doctors may look for characteristic physical features of the disorder, such as a small head size, low-set ears, and a flat face.'- This statement is false. While Edward's syndrome is associated with specific physical features, such as a small head size, low-set ears, and a flat face, it is not accurate to say that doctors may directly observe these features during a physical examination. These features are often identified through prenatal ultrasound or after birth.", "6. 'They may also perform tests to assess the baby's hearing and vision, as well as the function of the heart and kidneys.'- This statement is true.

Genetic testing is considered the most reliable and conclusive method to confirm a diagnosis of Edward's syndrome.", "8. 'This can be done through a variety of methods, including chromosomal analysis, which involves examining a sample of the baby's cells for the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 18.'- This statement is true. Chromosomal analysis, specifically examining the baby's cells for the presence of an additional copy of chromosome 18, is one of the ways to perform genetic testing for Edward's syndrome.", "9. 'Other genetic tests, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), can also be used to detect the presence of the extra chromosome.'- This statement is true. In addition to chromosomal analysis, methods like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) can also be employed to detect the presence of an additional chromosome 18.", "10. 'In some cases, prenatal diagnosis may be possible through chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, which involve removing a small sample of cells from the placenta or amniotic fluid for genetic testing.'- This statement is true. Prenatal diagnosis of Edward's syndrome can be achieved through procedures like chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, which involve extracting a small number of cells from either the placenta or the amniotic fluid to conduct genetic testing.", "11. 'These tests carry a small risk of miscarriage and should only be performed if there is a strong family history of Edward's syndrome or if the mother is at high risk for the disorder.'- This statement is false. While it is true that prenatal diagnostic tests like CVS and amniocentesis carry a slight risk of miscarriage, the decision to pursue these tests is not solely based on family history or maternal risk. Other factors, including advanced maternal age or abnormal prenatal screening results, may also influence the decision.", "12. 'Overall, early diagnosis of Edward's syndrome is important for appropriate management and support of the baby and family.'- This statement is true. Early detection and diagnosis of Edward's syndrome allow for timely interventions, medical management, and counseling to support both the affected baby and their family."]

['[Explanation]', "1. 'Binge eating disorder (BED) is a serious eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of consuming large amounts of food in a short period of time, often accompanied by a feeling of loss of control during the binge episode.' - This statement accurately describes the characteristics of binge eating disorder. It is a recognized eating disorder characterized by periods of excessive food consumption and a lack of control during those episodes. This statement is true.", "2. 'People with BED may feel ashamed or guilty after bingeing and may engage in compensatory behaviors such as purging or excessive exercise to prevent weight gain.' - It is common for individuals with binge eating disorder to experience feelings of shame or guilt after binge episodes. Some individuals may also engage in compensatory behaviors, such as purging or excessive exercise, in an attempt to counteract the effects of the binge. This statement is true.", "3. 'BED is different from bulimia nervosa, which also involves binge eating but also includes purging behavior such as vomiting or laxative abuse.' - This statement accurately highlights the difference between binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa.

'BED is also distinct from obesity, which is a medical condition characterized by excessive body weight and is often associated with a variety of health risks.' - This statement correctly distinguishes binge eating disorder from obesity. BED is an eating disorder, whereas obesity is a medical condition characterized by excessive body weight. Although individuals with BED may experience obesity as a result of their eating behaviors, the two are separate entities. This statement is true.", "5. 'BED is a common and underdiagnosed eating disorder that affects people of all ages and genders.' - Binge eating disorder is indeed a common eating disorder that affects individuals of all ages and genders. It is often underdiagnosed and can go unnoticed due to factors such as secrecy and lack of awareness. This statement is true.", "6.
