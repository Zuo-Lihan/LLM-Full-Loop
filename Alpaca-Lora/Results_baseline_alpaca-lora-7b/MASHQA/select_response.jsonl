Most often, it causes mild infections on the skin, like sores, boils, or abscesses. But it can also cause more serious skin infections or infect surgical wounds, the bloodstream, the lungs, or the urinary tract. Though most MRSA infections aren't serious, some can be life-threatening. Many public health experts are alarmed by the spread of tough strains of MRSA. Because it's hard to treat, MRSA is sometimes called a \"super bug.\" Garden-variety staph are common bacteria that can live in our bodies. Plenty of healthy people carry staph without being infected by it. In fact, one third of everybody has staph bacteria in their noses. But staph can be a problem if it manages to get into the body, often through a cut. Once there, it can cause an infection. Staph is one of the most common causes of skin infections in the U. S. Usually, these are minor and don't need special treatment. Less often, staph can cause serious problems like infected wounds or pneumonia. Staph can usually be treated with antibiotics. But over the decades, some strains of staph -- like MRSA -- have become resistant to antibiotics that once destroyed it. MRSA was first discovered in 1961. It's now resistant to methicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, oxacillin, and other common antibiotics known as cephalosporins. While some antibiotics still work, MRSA is constantly adapting. Researchers developing new antibiotics are having a tough time keeping up. MRSA is spread by contact. So, you could get MRSA by touching another person who has it on the skin. Or you could get it by touching objects that have the bacteria on them. MRSA is carried by about 2% of the population (or 2 in 100 people), although most of them aren't infected. There are two different populations of people who get MRSA -- one is in decline -- those who get it in hospitals or other health care environments -- and the other is on the rise -- those who get it in the community. MRSA infections are common among people who have weak immune systems who are in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care centers. Infections can appear around surgical wounds or invasive devices, like catheters or implanted feeding tubes. According to the CDC, invasive MRSA infections that began in hospitals declined 8% between 2011 and 2013. Community- Associated MRSA ( CA- MRSA) Alarmingly, MRSA is also showing up in healthy people who have not been hospitalized. This type of MRSA is called community-associated MRSA, or CA- MRSA. CA- MRSA skin infections have been identified among certain populations that share close quarters or have more skin-to-skin contact. Examples are team athletes, military recruits, prison inmates, and children in daycare. But more and more CA- MRSA infections are being seen in the general community, especially in certain geographic regions. CA- MRSA is also more likely to affect younger people.

The breast MRI should not be used in lieu of a breast biopsy to distinguish between benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) areas. Due to false positive results, this test may increase the number of breast biopsies that need to be performed. Although MRI may detect tumors in dense breast tissue, the presence of dense breast tissue is not a reason to have a breast MRI scan. Breast MRI scanning cannot detect tiny specks of calcium (known as microcalcifications), which account for half of the cancers detected by mammography. Talk to your doctor about whether you should have an MRI of the breasts. A breast MRI is safe. The test poses no risk to the average patient if appropriate safety guidelines are followed. People who have had heart surgery and people with the following medical devices can be safely examined with MRI: Surgical clips or sutures Artificial joints Staples Most heart valve replacements Disconnected medication pumps Vena cava filters Brain shunt tubes for hydrocephalus Some conditions may make an MRI exam inadvisable.

It's likely you've seen terms like âpersonalized medicine,â âprecision medicine,â or âtargeted drugs.â What are these things? More importantly, can they help you? Personalized medicine -- also called precision medicine or pharmacogenetics -- is a new way to fight cancer. It uses information about you and your tumor to figure out what's driving the disease and create a plan just for you. For years, cancer treatment was a cookie-cutter process. You'd have surgery to remove a tumor, then chemotherapy or radiation to kill cancer cells. But blasting cancers with chemotherapy or radiation kills healthy cells as well, which can lead to a host of nasty side effects. Now, researchers can examine your cancer cells and learn the order of the genes in their DNA. While most cells in your body have identical genes, the ones in cancer cells have mutations, or changes. This is what allows them to grow into tumors. What's more, your cancer may have different genetic changes than someone else's. Scientists also now know that genetically, one person's breast cancer may be more similar to another person's stomach tumor than to other breast cancers. This makes the need for personalized medicine even greater. The FDA has approved more than a dozen drugs that target one of these mutations. They include imatinib ( Gleevec), a drug used on chronic myelogenous leukemia, and the breast cancer drug trastuzumab ( Herceptin). Tumor genetics can also tell doctors which drugs won't work. For example, if your colon cancer has a genetic mutation called KRAS, doctors won't give you two common colon cancer drugs because they know they won't work. Many clinical centers do something called tumor profiling. Your doctor takes a look at your tumor's genes. If he thinks your cancer may have specific mutations, he might start you on a specific drug that is tailored for the genetic mutation found in your cancer cells. For instance, if you have breast cancer, a genetic test would tell him if Herceptin might work for you. Profiling can also help if other treatment options, like chemotherapy, haven't worked for you. A genetic mutation might point your medical team toward an unexpected drug, like one originally designed for another type of cancer. The personalized approach works better to shrink tumors -- and save lives -- than traditional treatment. But it isn't always a cure. Tumors can contain cells with different gene mutations, so a targeted therapy designed to pick off cells with one mutation may work on only part of a tumor. The cells that remain may keep growing. Talk to your doctor to find out if this approach could work for you. Standard trials to test cancer treatments use people whose tumors are similar in size or location. They might choose only people with stage IV lung cancer, for instance. But now that there's personalized medicine, researchers need new ways to study how targeted treatments work on a variety of cancers. Basket trials combine folks with many different cancer types into a single âbasketâ and use a precision medicine approach to find treatments that work. So a single trial could include people on many different drugs. The creation of new treatments requires a constant back-and-forth between doctors and scientists. New drugs are made to combat new gene changes. Then, they're tested in the clinic. As tumors change in new ways, more new drugs will become available.", "question": "How do clinical trials that use \"personalized\" medicine work?", "answer": ["Standard trials to test cancer treatments use people whose tumors are similar in size or location.

S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana in some form, and more are considering bills to do the same. Yet while many people are using marijuana, the FDA has only approved it for treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox- Gastaut syndrome. Why hasn't more research been done? One reason is that the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, and likely to be abused and lacking in medical value. Because of that, researchers need a special license to study it, says Marcel Bonn- Miller, Ph D, a substance abuse specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. That may not change anytime soon. The DEA considered reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II drug like Ritalin or oxycodone, but decided ito keep it as a Schedule I drug.

He shared some background on medical marijuana's uses and potential side effects. Medical marijuana uses the marijuana plant or chemicals in it to treat diseases or conditions. It's basically the same product as recreational marijuana, but it's taken for medical purposes. The marijuana plant contains more than 100 different chemicals called cannabinoids. Each one has a different effect on the body. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) and cannabidiol ( CBD) are the main chemicals used in medicine. THC also produces the \"high\" people feel when they smoke marijuana or eat foods containing it. var ia Module Data = ia Module Data || []; ia Module Data.push({ type: ' Video', id: 'ia-video-1', position: 'left', mode: 'interactive', video: { chronicle ID: '091e9c5e81408112', title: ' Medical Marijuana: What Does It Treat?

Cannabinoids -- the active chemicals in medical marijuana -- are similar to chemicals the body makes that are involved in appetite, memory, movement, and pain. Research suggests cannabinoids might: Reduce anxiety Reduce inflammation and relieve pain Control nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy Kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth Relax tight muscles in people with MS Stimulate appetite and improve weight gain in people with cancer and AIDS Medical marijuana received a lot of attention a few years ago when parents said that a special form of the drug helped control seizures in their children. The FDA recently approved Epidiolex, which is made from CBD, as a therapy for people with very severe or hard-to-treat seizures. In studies, some people had a dramatic drop in seizures after taking this drug. Medical marijuana is legal in 33 states and the District of Columbia: Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Hawaii Illinois Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Missouri Montana Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island Utah Vermont Washington West Virginia States that allow restricted use only include: Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. To get medical marijuana, you need a written recommendation from a licensed doctor in states where that is legal. ( Not every doctor is willing to recommend medical marijuana for their patients.) You must have a condition that qualifies for medical marijuana use. Each state has its own list of qualifying conditions. Your state may also require you to get a medical marijuana ID card. Once you have that card, you can buy medical marijuana at a store called a dispensary. To take medical marijuana, you can: Smoke it Inhale it through a device called a vaporizer that turns it into a mist Eat it -- for example, in a brownie or lollipop Apply it to your skin in a lotion, spray, oil, or cream Place a few drops of a liquid under your tongue How you take it is up to you. Each method works differently in your body. \" If you smoke or vaporize cannabis, you feel the effects very quickly,\" Bonn- Miller says. \" If you eat it, it takes significantly longer. It can take 1 to 2 hours to experience the effects from edible products.\" The FDA has approved two man-made cannabinoid medicines -- dronabinol ( Marinol, Syndros) and nabilone ( Cesamet) -- to treat nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy. The cannabidiol Epidiolex was approved in 2018 for treating seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox- Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.

Although the specific cause is unknown, certain factors are recognized as contributing to high blood pressure. Age: The older you get, the greater the likelihood that you will develop high blood pressure, especially systolic, as your arteries get stiffer. This is largely due to atherosclerosis, or \"hardening of the arteries.\" Race: African- Americans have high blood pressure more often than whites. They develop high blood pressure at a younger age and develop more severe complications sooner. Family history (heredity): The tendency to have high blood pressure appears to run in families. Gender: Generally men have a greater likelihood of developing high blood pressure than women. This likelihood varies according to age and among various ethnic groups. Obesity: Obesity is defined as being 30% or more over your healthy body weight. It is very closely related to high blood pressure. Indeed, obese people are two to six times more likely to develop high blood pressure than people whose weight is within a healthy range. Medical professionals strongly recommend that all obese people with high blood pressure lose weight until they are within 15% of their healthy body weight. Your health care provider can help you calculate your healthy body weight range. Sodium (salt) sensitivity: Some people have high sensitivity to sodium (salt), and their blood pressure goes up if they use salt. Reducing sodium intake tends to lower their blood pressure. Americans consume 10-15 times more sodium than they need. Fast foods and processed foods contain particularly high amounts of sodium. Many over-the-counter medicines, such as painkillers, also contain large amounts of sodium. Read labels to find out how much sodium is contained in food items. Avoid those with high sodium levels. Your goal should be to consume no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day. Alcohol use: Drinking more than 1-2 drinks of alcohol per day tends to raise blood pressure in those who are sensitive to alcohol. Birth control pills (oral contraceptive use): Some women who take birth control pills develop high blood pressure. Lack of exercise (physical inactivity): A sedentary lifestyle contributes to the development of obesity and high blood pressure. Drugs: Certain drugs, such as amphetamines (stimulants), diet pills, and some pills used for cold and allergy symptoms, tend to raise blood pressure.", "question": "What conditions cause secondary hypertension?", "answer": ["These causes include the following conditions: Chronic kidney disease Sleep apnea Tumors or other diseases of the adrenal gland Coarctation of the aorta -- A narrowing of the aorta that you are born with that can cause high blood pressure in the arms Pregnancy Use of birth control pills Alcohol addiction Thyroid dysfunction In the other 90% of cases, the cause of high blood pressure is not known (primary hypertension)."], "generated_answer": "Conditions that cause secondary hypertension include renal artery stenosis, renovascular disease, coarctation of the aorta, and congenital defects of the kidney."}

It can feel good when you help ease some of it. That isn't always easy to do, so talk to a doctor about it first. You can try these ways to help relieve his aches and pains at home: Some people hold back from talking about pain. They may not want to be a burden, or they may feel that it's a sign of weakness to admit it. Encourage them that it's OK to let you know how they really feel, so you can help them take care of it. Or they may have trouble expressing it if they have dementia or have had a stroke. It's important to help treat pain, so your loved one can keep up with daily activities, stay as independent as possible, and feel better mentally and physically. Ask the person you're caring for if he is in pain. Many of the signs are obvious -- crying, moaning, clenched fists, âknittedâ eyebrows. A poor appetite may also be a clue. If the person can't tell you if they're in pain, you may need to have a doctor or therapist do an exam, including a check for bedsores. A warm shower or bath, hot water bottle, or warm cloth can help relax muscles and ease muscle spasms. A heating pad with an automatic off switch is better than a regular heating pad, which can burn skin if left on too long. Be careful with microwavable heating pads, as these can have hot spots that burn. Apply heat to the sore area for 20 to 30 minutes every 2 hours. Don't use heat on open wounds. Cold can numb pain and ease swelling. Try a cool cloth, cold pack, cold compression wrap, or ice massage. To make an ice pack, put crushed ice in a plastic bag and cover it with a towel. Don't put the bag of ice directly on your loved one's skin. Or you can use a bag of frozen peas. Ice as soon as possible after an injury. Do it for 15-20 minutes at a time, 4-8 times per day. Stop icing when the area feels numb. Slow, quiet breathing helps relax the body and mind and ease pain. You can show your loved one how to do this: Lie or sit with one hand on your belly and take a deep, slow breath. Imagine filling a balloon in your belly with air. Then breathe out, as if you're letting all the air out of the balloon. Think of breathing out stressful thoughts and breathing in relaxation. Aim for about six long, deep breaths a minute. If your loved one has lung problems, talk to his doctor about what breathing exercises would be good to try, or if other ways to relax would be better. This can be as simple as a foot, back, or hand rub. With your whole hand, the heel of your hand, or your fingertips, apply gentle pressure in slow, steady, circular movements. Warm oil or lotion may help. Massage in one area for 10 seconds first to see if it feels good. Notice if he prefers a light stroke or a firm one. It shouldn't cause pain. Ask your loved one's doctor what nonprescription pain medicines are OK to use, if needed. Acetaminophen is probably the safest for mild to moderate pain. Never use more than your doctor recommends, because it can cause liver damage and other side effects. And check to make sure the person is not taking other drugs that have acetaminophen as an ingredient. This is a common problem. There are also pain relievers that go directly on the skin, such as creams, gels, sprays, and patches. If your loved one has long-term (chronic) pain, he might need over-the-counter as well as prescription drugs, including daily, extended-release pain medications and a plan for pain flare-ups. Keep a list of all the medications (prescription or over-the-counter), supplements, and doses your loved one takes, and share that list with their doctor. This is important to do because some combinations of medicines can be harmful, particularly for elderly people. Their doctor can check on safety and make changes if needed.

But if you're diagnosed with cervical cancer, know it's very treatable when your doctor finds it early. It's also one of the most preventable cancers in women because of available screenings and vaccinations. While regular screenings are the most important thing you can do to detect precancerous cells, there are other things you also need to know to spot symptoms early. The most important step to find precancerous cervical cells is getting screened. Tests can pick up changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Pap tests look for abnormal cells in your cervix that are starting to turn into cancer. Your gynecologist will perform a Pap test during your routine pelvic exam. It's quick and painless. You lie on an exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to keep your vagina open. It also lets her see your cervix. Next, she'll use a small brush to swab some cells from your cervix. The cells are sent a lab where they're checked for signs of cancer. Most women ages 21 to 65 need to be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap test every 3 years. You can get an HPV test alone or with your Pap test, known as co-testing, every five years starting after age 30. Human papilloma virus is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the high-risk types of the virus cause almost all cervical cancers. If you test positive for HPV, that doesn't mean you'll get cervical cancer. If you're over age 30, doctors recommend you get both tests every 3-5 years. Most women in the early stages of cervical cancer don't have any symptoms. That's why Pap and HPV screening tests are so important. Symptoms don't usually start until the cancer spreads to other organs and tissues. If you do have symptoms, you might notice: Abnormal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or after menopause) Heavier than normal periods Pain during sex Unusual vaginal discharge that might contain blood These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other diseases or infections cause them, too. See your gynecologist if you notice any of them. If you have an abnormal Pap test and other symptoms of cervical cancer, your gynecologist will want find out more about your medical history and your family's. She'll likely run more tests to find out if you have cancer cells in your cervix, and check your lymph nodes to see if cancer has spread. Some of the tests your gynecologist might use to check for cancer cells include: Colposcopy. During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix. This liquid helps her see any abnormal cells. It might burn a little. Cervical biopsies. Your doctor might also remove a small piece of tissue during your colposcopy to check for cancer. This is known as a colposcopic biopsy. Other types of biopsies include: Endocervical curettage uses a thin instrument called a curette to scrape away cells Loop electro-surgical excision procedure ( LEEP) uses a thin wire heated by an electric current to remove cells Punch biopsy uses a tool called biopsy forceps to remove tissue Cone biopsy is another, more invasive, way for your doctor to take a tissue sample, so it's usually performed in a hospital. It can also treat some early-stage cervical cancers. Your doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix with either a LEEP, scalpel or laser. Cells taken from your cervix from any type of biopsy will be sent to a lab and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. You might have mild cramps and bleeding after these procedures. If your biopsy shows you have cervical cancer, the next step is to see if it has spread, and where. Your doctor might order one or more of these tests: Cystoscopy and proctoscopy. These tests both use a lighted tube to see if the cancer has spread into your bladder and rectum. CT scan. This powerful X-ray can show your doctor if your cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, liver, lungs, or other parts of your body. MRI. Your doctor might use an MRI to get very detailed images of inside your body. An MRI can find cancer that has spread to your pelvis, brain, or spinal cord. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will look to see if cancer has spread to your lungs. Positron emission tomography ( PET). Your doctor might order a PET scan if she thinks your cancer has spread but isn't sure where. It uses a type of radioactive sugar that cancer cells absorb. A special camera can spot the cells that have absorbed the sugar. After all of the tests results are back, your doctor will use them to determine if and how far your cancer has spread, which will show them what stage it is in. Staging classifies the cancer by how much is in your body and where it has spread when it's diagnosed. Knowing the stage can help your medical team plan the right treatment for you. Stages of cervical cancer are: Stage 0. Cancer is only on the surface of the cervix and have not grown into deeper tissues. Stage I. The cancer has grown into the cervix and may be growing into the body of the uterus. It may also have spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread distantly. Stage II. The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and uterus. It may have reached the upper part of the vagina. It may involve local lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage III. The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina or the walls of the pelvis. It may or may not involve the nearby lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage IV. This is the most advanced stage. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, like the bladder, rectum, lungs, liver, or distant lymph nodes. Your stage of a cancer won't be changed if your cancer gets worse or comes back.

High blood sugar can lead to other conditions, like eye problems. The most common one is diabetic macular edema. It's serious and can rob you of your vision. That's a scary possibility, but knowing what to look out for and getting the right treatment can help protect your sight. Even if you don't notice problems, when you have diabetes, it's important you get your eyes checked every year. If you do have a problem, see an ophthalmologist right away. This type of doctor treats eye diseases. If you catch it early, there's a chance you can stop long-term damage. High blood sugar weakens the blood vessels in your eyes. That can make them leak or grow out of control in your retina, the light-sensitive area at the back of your eye. This is called diabetic retinopathy. When fluid seeps into your retina, it can cause diabetic macular edema. The leaking makes your retina swell, which hampers the work of your macula, the special, sensitive part that gives you sharp vision. Diabetic macular edema doesn't always cause symptoms. But you may: Have images directly in front of you appear blurry or wavy See colors that seem âwashed outâ If this happens to you, see your doctor right away. Before any testing, your doctor may ask you questions: Have you noticed changes in your vision? If so, what kind? Have you been diagnosed with diabetes? If so, when? Does anyone in your family have it? How have your blood sugar and A1c levels been lately? Do you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Do you have any other medical conditions? You will need a thorough eye exam, which usually includes: A visual acuity test. It checks how well you see at different distances. A dilated eye exam. Your doctor will use drops to widen your pupils and look at the inside of your eyes. He'll look for signs of disease, including damaged or leaking blood vessels, swelling, and fatty deposits on the retina. If your doctor thinks you have diabetic macular edema, you may also need one or both of these tests: A fluorescein angiogram ( FA) takes pictures of your retina using a special dye that helps find any leaking blood vessels. The dye is injected into your arm, but travels quickly to your eye. Optical coherence tomography ( OCT) uses a special camera to photograph your retina. It is very sensitive and can find even small amounts of fluid and swelling. What is causing my symptoms? Will I lose my sight? Am I at risk for other eye diseases? Do you have experience treating diabetic macular edema? What type of treatment do you recommend for me? What can I expect from it? What else can I do to protect my vision? How often will I need to have my eyes checked? To treat diabetic macular edema, doctors may use drugs that are injected into your eyes to help stop leaking, and to slow the growth of new blood vessels. These drugs include: Avastin (bevacizumab) Eylea (aflibercept) Iluvien (fluocinolone acetonide) Lucentis (ranibizumab) Macugen (pegaptanib) In severe cases, you may also have laser photocoagulation. A doctor will use a tiny laser on your eye to seal leaking blood vessels. You may need more than one treatment to control the problem. It's usually not painful, but you may have slight stinging feeling when the laser touches you. Sometimes steroid injections may help. Another treatment is a surgery called vitrectomy. This is usually done because of bleeding (not macular edema), and doctors take out the fluid that is clouding your vision and replace it with a clear solution. There's a lot you can do to prevent your condition from getting worse. First, manage your diabetes by controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Diet changes, keeping a healthy weight, and exercise can all help you manage these problems. Talk with your doctor about the best way to do this. Also, don't sidestep regular eye exams. Symptoms can sneak up. Your doctor needs to see you to keep track of track of how your treatment is working. Have you already lost some vision? Talk to your doctor about visual aids, like magnifying glasses, if eyeglasses alone aren't enough. Ask him about resources in your area that can help you learn skills for living with vision loss. Treatment can help you protect your vision. It can greatly decrease your chance of losing your vision. Stay on top of your diabetes, and stick with your treatment plan. You'll have the best chance of maintaining your sight and staying independent.

The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, defines complementary and alternative medicine as a \"group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.\" Complementary medicine is used with conventional treatments, whereas alternative medicine is used instead of conventional medicine. Although some may be effective, others aren't or can even be harmful. If you want to try complementary or alternative medicine, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons and what may be a good idea for you. Acupuncture is a procedure where a practitioner inserts very thin needles into specific points on your skin. Some scientists say that acupuncture triggers the release of the body's natural painkillers. Acupuncture has been shown to offer relief from chronic pain and is sometimes used by people with neuropathy, the painful nerve damage that can happen with diabetes. Biofeedback is a technique that helps you become more aware of -- and learn to deal with -- your body's response to pain. This therapy emphasizes relaxation and stress-reduction techniques. Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that some professionals who use biofeedback also practice. With guided imagery, you'll think of peaceful mental images, such as ocean waves, or perhaps images of controlling or curing your disease. People using this technique say these positive images can ease their condition. The benefit of taking chromiumhas been studied and debated for several years. You need the mineral to make glucose tolerance factor, which helps insulin work better. Several studies suggest that chromium supplements may improve diabetes control, but we don't have enough information to recommend it to treat diabetes yet. Several types of plants are referred to as ginseng, but most studies have used American ginseng. They've shown some sugar-lowering effects in fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, as well as in A1c results (average blood sugar levels over a 3-month period). But we need larger and more long-term studies. Researchers also found that the amount of sugar-lowering compound in ginseng plants varies widely. Although the relationship between magnesiumand diabetes has been studied for decades, we still don't fully understand it. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. And evidence suggests that a magnesium deficiency may contribute to some diabetes complications. People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. Early studies showed that vanadium normalized blood sugar levels in animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When people with diabetes were given vanadium, they had a modest increase in insulin sensitivity and were able to lower their need for insulin. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages. Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control. Most plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. People with type 2 diabetes may focus on: Brewer's yeast Buckwheat Broccoli and other related greens Cinnamon Cloves Coffee Okra Leafy greens Fenugreek seeds Sage Some studies show that certain plant foods may help your body fight inflammation and use insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Cinnamon extracts can improve sugar metabolism, triggering insulin release, which also boosts cholesterol metabolism. Clove oil extracts (eugenol) have been found to help insulin work and to lower glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. An unidentified compound in coffee (not caffeine) may enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The scientific evidence thus far doesn't support the role of garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle for blood sugar control in people with diabetes. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first. Since being overweight and having diabetes are linked, many people with diabetes turn to natural alternative therapies that claim to help with weight loss, including: Chitosan Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) Chromium Pyruvate Germander Momordica charantia ( Chinese bitter melon) Sauropus androgynus (sweet leaf bush) Aristolochic acid There are also skin patch (transdermal) systems as well as oral sprays that supposedly curb your appetite and make it easier to lose weight. What's the bottom line? Check with your doctor, because many of these so-called \"obesity remedies\" haven't been studied, aren't effective, or just aren't safe. In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke. Chitosan comes from seashells and can bind to fat to prevent absorption. Studies thus far haven't been encouraging for weight loss though. Germander, Momordica charantia, Sauropus androgynus, and aristolochic acid have been linked with liver disease, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease. A survey of herbal preparations for obesity found that many had lead or arsenic and other toxic metals. Some also had other ingredients that weren't included on the label. And sometimes, the wrong plant was listed.

It is most common in adults ages 30 to 50, but people of all ages can have it. Children make up about 10% of all cases. Few pheochromocytoma tumors spread to other organs. But they can be dangerous and should be treated right away. Your adrenal glands make hormones that control your metabolism, blood pressure, and other important functions. A pheochromocytoma also releases hormones and does so at much higher levels than normal. The hormones made by these tumors cause high blood pressure, which can damage your heart, brain, lungs, and kidneys. Some people with these tumors have high blood pressure all the time. For others, it goes up and down. High blood pressure may be your only symptom. But most people have at least one of the following as well: Constipation Dizziness when standing Nausea Pale skin Racing heartbeat (heart palpitations) Severe headache Stomach, side, or back pain Unusual sweating These symptoms can come on suddenly, like an attack, several times a day. But they also can happen just a few times a month. As the tumor grows, these attacks may become stronger and happen more often. If you or your child has symptoms like these, see a doctor right away. Doctors don't know why most of these tumors form. About 30%, however, seem to run in families. These are more likely to be cancerous than ones that appear randomly. They can spread to other parts of your body, including your liver, lungs, or bones. The tumors are more common in people with inherited disorders or conditions, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type II Von Hippel- Lindau disease Neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1) Hereditary paraganglioma syndrome Many people who have pheochromocytoma are never diagnosed because the symptoms are so much like those of other conditions. But there are ways to find out if you have one of the tumors: Blood or urine tests to tell if you have high levels of hormones in your body An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make images of organs and tissues to check for a tumor A CT scan (computed tomography), which puts together several X-rays taken from different angles to see if there's a tumor. If you have a pheochromocytoma, your doctor may recommend tests to see if it was caused by a genetic disorder. This can tell you if you're at risk for more in the future and whether your children and other family members are at higher risk. A parent with a damaged gene has a 50% chance of passing it to his or her child. You'll most likely need surgery to remove the tumor. Your surgeon may be able to do this using tiny cuts instead of one large opening. This is called laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, surgery. It can shorten your recovery time. Before the surgery, you may need to take medication to lower your blood pressure and control an occasional fast heart rate. If you have a tumor in only one adrenal gland, your surgeon will probably remove that whole gland. Your other gland will still make the hormones your body needs. If you have tumors in both glands, your surgeon may remove just the tumors and leave part of the glands. If both glands need to be removed, you can take steroids to help replace the hormones your body won't be able to make anymore. If all goes well with the surgery, chances are good that your symptoms will go away and your blood pressure will return to normal.

They feel bone pain. In rare instances when it grows quickly or aggressively or has been there for a while, it can even lead to things like fracture. The most common bones that it spreads to are spine, hips, and ribs. So very rarely do we see it like in the bones in the lower extremities, for example, or the bones of the hand. So bone is one of the most common sites of spread of breast cancer when it spreads outside the breasts and surrounding lymph nodes. And it can often happen shortly after diagnosis, or it can happen years down the line. The goals of treatment of bony metastases from breast cancer include improving quality of life, so reducing pain, reducing the spread of cancer. So if you can keep it at bay and stop it from spreading to any other bones or worsening, where it already is. With bone metastases, I would say one of the unique things about that is that they can cause pain. So we do want to make sure that we manage pain optimally whether it's with medication, whether it's with focused radiation to a bone it's affected. And also, that we do things like preventing fracture. So often we'll co-manage these patients as oncologists, along with radiation oncologists, even orthopedic surgeons, to help make sure that we can control those situations adequately. if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } Many different treatments can help if your cancer has spread to bone, commonly called bone metastasis or bone \"mets.\" Treatment can't cure bone metastasis, but it can relieve pain, help prevent complications, and improve your quality of life. Doctors use two types of treatments for metastatic cancer in the bones. Systemic treatments can reach cancer cells throughout the body. Local treatments directly target the cancer in the bone. The treatment you get will depend upon: Where your cancer started, and the kind of primary tumor you have Which bones the cancer has invaded The extent of damage to the bones Which types of treatment you already have had Your overall health Let your doctor know if your treatment isn't easing your pain and other symptoms. You may find that other approaches work better for you. Chemotherapy is a common systemic treatment for bone metastasis. Your doctor will use a type of chemo that is effective against your primary tumor. So, if you have metastatic lung cancer, for example, your doctor will use drugs that are effective against lung cancer. How it works. Anti-cancer drugs target and curb cancer growth. In most cases, you take chemo by mouth or through a vein (by IV). This can often shrink the tumors, which will ease your pain and help you feel better. Possible side effects. Chemo can kill normal cells in addition to cancer cells. The side effects you might have will depend on: The type and amount of drugs you take The length of your treatment Common side effects of chemotherapy include: Loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting Hair loss Mouth sores Infection Bleeding or bruising Weakness or fatigue Your doctor can help you prevent or manage these. Most side effects go away once you stop treatment. This group of drugs works best in cases where metastasis is weakening the bone. How it works. You receive bisphosphonates by mouth or IV infusion every 3 to 4 weeks. These drugs help with bone metastasis by: Slowing bone damage and reducing the risk of bone fractures Easing bone pain Reducing high levels of calcium in the blood Possible side effects. The most common ones include: Fatigue Fever Nausea or vomiting Anemia Bone or joint pain A rare and serious side effect is bone death (osteonecrosis) of the jaw. Ask your doctor about precautions to take before beginning this treatment. Osteonecrosis may cause: Jaw bone pain, swelling, or numbness Loss of gum tissue Loose teeth Infection Another available treatment is denosumab ( Prolia, Xgeva). It's given by injection and may work as well as or better than bisphosphonates to prevent fractures. But it also can cause osteonecrosis, as well as low calcium levels in the blood. These drugs contain radioactive elements that target cancer cells. Doctors tend to use this systemic treatment when the metastasis is stimulating new bone growth. This is more common with prostate cancer. If your cancer has spread to many bones, these drugs may be a better option than standard radiation, which uses a beam to aim radiation at each bone metastasis. However, sometimes doctors combine radiopharmaceuticals and standard radiation. How it works. The doctor injects a single dose of the drug into a vein. It then travels to the areas of bone with cancer and gives off radiation to kill the cancer. This single dose may be effective against pain for several months. You can receive another treatment later. Possible side effects. The most common ones include: Infections Bleeding Temporary increase in pain (flare reaction) This systemic treatment helps your immune system spot and more effectively kill cancer cells. Some methods of immunotherapy have been used for a while, and some are still experimental. How it works. Immunotherapy works in one of two main ways: It boosts your body's immune system to fight the cancer. It uses a man-made version of proteins to kill cancer cells. Examples of immunotherapy for cancer include: Cytokines -- substances secreted by the immune system that have an effect on other cells Monoclonal antibodies -- a class of antibodies made in the lab from a single population of cells Tumor vaccines -- vaccines using a substance that prompts the immune system to respond to a tumor Possible side effects. Side effects vary, depending upon the type of immunotherapy. They may include: Fever and chills Weakness Headache Nausea or diarrhea Rashes Radiation is a \"local treatment\" because it does not affect your entire body. It uses high-energy X-rays or particles to destroy or slow the growth of cancer cells in the bone. It helps most if you have only one or two bone metastases. You may receive it alone or combined with other types of treatment. How it works. A machine focuses a beam of radiation on the bone metastasis. This treatment, called external beam radiation, lasts only a few minutes. You may receive radiation in one large dose or in smaller amounts over several treatments. Possible side effects. Early, temporary side effects depend on the location being treated, but may include: Fatigue Skin changes Surgery can often help relieve bone metastasis symptoms. How it works. If a bone is broken, surgery may help relieve pain quickly. Surgery can also help stabilize a weak bone to keep it from breaking. The surgeon may insert: Screws Rods Pins Plates Cages Possible side effects. These include the usual risks of any surgery, such as infection. If surgery is not an option, your doctor may use a cast or splint, or inject bone cement to help you move better and relieve pain. With this local treatment, a needle or probe is put into the tumor to destroy it. Though used more often for other types of metastasis, ablation can help if you have a problem with one or two bone tumors. How it works. Some methods of ablation use chemicals or alcohol to kill the tumor. Two common methods include: Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA). A needle delivers an electric current to heat the tumor. Cryoablation. A probe is used to freeze the tumor. Afterward, the doctor may fill the space created by ablation with bone cement to help stabilize the bone. Possible side effects. This procedure is generally safe but may cause some temporary soreness, swelling, and bruising. This noninvasive procedure uses ultrasound energy and imaging technology to provide pain relief by destroying nerve endings in the area of the tumor. Because there is no incision, and no probe is inserted, the procedure is typically done on an outpatient basis with a local anesthetic rather than general anesthesia. While complications are possible, they are rare. How it works. A specialist uses imaging to target the specific area to be treated with ultrasound. Then, heat that's made when ultrasound penetrates the targeted tissue destroys nerve endings in the bone around the tumor. The destruction of nerve endings results in pain relief.

They feel bone pain. In rare instances when it grows quickly or aggressively or has been there for a while, it can even lead to things like fracture. The most common bones that it spreads to are spine, hips, and ribs. So very rarely do we see it like in the bones in the lower extremities, for example, or the bones of the hand. So bone is one of the most common sites of spread of breast cancer when it spreads outside the breasts and surrounding lymph nodes. And it can often happen shortly after diagnosis, or it can happen years down the line. The goals of treatment of bony metastases from breast cancer include improving quality of life, so reducing pain, reducing the spread of cancer.

Your eyes are no exception -- they need vitamins and minerals to ease your chance of having problems and protect your vision. If you're looking to boost your eye health and help your dry eye symptoms, focus on these key nutrients. Filling up on these can ease the scratchy, stinging irritation of dry eye. Specifically, omega-3s help soothe inflammation in your eyelids or on the surface of your eye. They may also help your tears do their job better. An omega-3-rich diet helps glands in your eye called meibomian glands make the oily part of your tears. The oil helps keep your tears from drying up too quickly in your eye. Fish is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids. Go for one of these oily varieties at least twice a week: Tuna (fresh, not canned) Mackerel Salmon Sardines Herring Anchovies You can also get omega-3 fatty acids from: Nuts and seeds (like flaxseed) Vegetable oil Soybeans Green, leafy vegetables You may also need to take an omega-3 fatty acid supplement. Talk to your doctor about it before you try one. These two antioxidants cut your odds of having many chronic eye diseases. Among other things, they help keep the cells in your eye healthy and working well. You can get them by eating eggs, corn, and leafy greens like: Kale Broccoli Spinach Collards A supplement may help here, too. Still, talk to your doctor before you take one. This antioxidant, also called ascorbic acid, is important for the blood vessels in your eyes. It's especially helpful in preventing cataracts, but it helps your overall eye health, too. Best sources of vitamin C include: Orange juice Grapefruit juice Oranges Cooked spinach Tomatoes Bananas Apples Women should aim for a minimum of 75 milligrams a day, which is about a cup of orange juice. Men need a little more -- around 90 milligrams a day. The antioxidant power of this nutrient protects the cells in your eyes from damage. It also boosts your body's immune system. You can get it by eating: Wheat cereal (wheat germ) Almonds Sunflower seeds Peanut butter Hazelnuts Sweet potato This is an important mineral that helps get vitamin A from your liver to your retina to make something called melanin. That's a pigment that protects your eyes. When you don't get enough zinc, your eyes are at a higher risk of infection. Your body doesn't make zinc naturally, so getting it through food is important.

Clots happen when blood thickens and sticks together. That can be a good thing when it prevents you from bleeding, but not so much when a clot forms inside your blood vessels. Sometimes, one can travel to your lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism ( PE), and it can be life-threatening if it blocks blood flow. While a clot can form after any type of procedure, you're more likely to get one if you've had major surgery, particularly on your abdomen, pelvis, hips, or legs. DVT is common after an operation because you're usually staying in bed for long periods of time while you recover. When you stop moving, blood flows more slowly in your deep veins, which can lead to a clot. You're most likely to get a clot between 2 and 10 days after your surgery, but your odds are higher for about 3 months. You may have a greater chance of DVT after surgery when you: Smoke Had DVT in the past Are overweight or obese Have close family members with DVT Are pregnant Have a disorder that affects your blood or veins Are older Use certain medicines, including birth control and hormone therapy Have specific types of cancer Sometimes, the surgery itself can cause a blood clot. Long procedures where you're lying on the operating table for many hours allow your blood to settle and pool, which makes it easier to clot. Tissue, debris, fat, or collagen could get released into your blood system during an operation, making blood thicker around those particles. Blood clots can also form if your veins are damaged during an operation. Surgeries that involve scraping or cutting into a bone, such as a hip replacement, may release substances known as antigens. These antigens trigger your body's immune system and can lead to clots. Only about half of people who get DVT have symptoms. Let your doctor know right away if you have any signs of DVT or PE: Pain or tenderness in your leg Swelling or warmth in your leg Red or discolored skin on your leg Veins that stick out Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Sudden chest pain Painful breathing Before your surgery, stop smoking. Work on getting rid of any extra pounds you're carrying. Talk to your doctor if you need help. After your surgery, you'll want you to keep your blood moving. Your doctor may prescribe blood thinner medicines, which are also called anticoagulants. They make it harder for your blood to stick together and form clots. Simple movements, such as leg lifts while you're in bed, can improve blood flow. You might need to take pain medicine so you can exercise comfortably.

It's not cancer. These lumps are one the most common breast lumps in young women. Many times, they will shrink and disappear with no treatment. In other cases, doctors can remove them. A fibroadenoma is a benign, or noncancerous, breast tumor. Unlike a breast cancer, which grows larger over time and can spread to other organs, a fibroadenoma remains in the breast tissue. They're pretty small, too. Most are only 1 or 2 centimeters in size. It's very rare for them to get larger than 5 centimeters across. Usually, a fibroadenoma won't cause any pain. It will feel like a marble that moves around beneath your skin. You may describe the texture as firm, smooth, or rubbery. In some cases, though, you won't even be able to feel it at all. Since they're usually painless, you might not notice one until you feel a lump while you're in the shower. Other times, a doctor might find it on a mammogram or ultrasound. Unlike breast cancer, a fibroadenoma doesn't cause nipple discharge, swelling, redness, or skin irritation around the breast. Doctors don't know what causes them. They may be related to changing levels of hormones, since they often appear during puberty or pregnancy and go away after menopause. There are a few different kinds: Simple fibroadenomas. They look the same all over when you view them under a microscope. Complex fibroadenomas. These are bigger and tend to affect older women. They might have cells that grow rapidly. Juvenile fibroadenomas. These are the most common type of breast lump found in girls and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 18. They can grow large, but most shrink over time. Some disappear. Giant fibroadenomas. They can grow to larger than 2 inches. They may need to be removed it they press on or replace other breast tissue. Fibroadenomas are very common. About 10% of women have one of these breast lumps, often without ever knowing. They most often appear in women between the ages of 15 and 35, or during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Some researchers have found that women with a family history of breast cancer are more likely to get fibroadenomas. Most women only have one. But about 10% to 15% of women who get them have more than one, either at the same time or over time. If you find a lump in your breast, you should see your doctor. You can't tell for sure what it is by how it feels. Your doctor will likely feel the lump so he can gauge its texture and size. Even if he thinks it might be a fibroadenoma, he'll recommend that you get more tests to confirm it. You may get an ultrasound or a mammogram, depending on your age and whether you're pregnant. Both are quick scans that you'll get in the doctor's office. A radiologist will then check the images of your breast tissue to see if it's a fibroadenoma or something else. The only way for a doctor to get know for sure that it's a fibroadenoma is through a biopsy, which means taking a sample of the lump to test in a lab. Based on the results of your examination and scan, your doctor will decide whether he needs to get extra confirmation from a biopsy. To do a biopsy, a doctor will insert a thin needle into your breast and pull out a small sample from the lump. You might not need any treatment. If your fibroadenoma is small, your doctor may recommend simply waiting to see whether the lump grows or shrinks rather than trying to remove it right away. Similarly, if you get a fibroadenoma during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, your doctor might wait until your hormone levels return to normal levels to see if the lump disappears on its own. If you've had more than one fibroadenoma removed in the past, and tests confirmed that that's what they were, your doctor also may delay removing any new lumps. If your fibroadenoma gets larger, the doctor suspects that it might, or he isn't sure whether a lump is a fibroadenoma or not, he'll likely recommend removing any lumps. This will help confirm that a lump isn't cancer and that it doesn't grow and distort the surrounding breast tissue. Depending on the size, location, and number of fibroadenomas, doctors have several ways to take them out: Lumpectomy or excisional biopsy: This is a short surgery to remove a fibroadenoma. Cryoablation: The doctor uses an ultrasound machine to see your fibroadenoma. He'll hold a tool called a cryoprobe against your skin. It uses a gas to freeze the nearby tissue, which destroys the fibroadenoma without surgery. Most women won't need anything beyond routine screening tests. They'll continue to get any breast changes checked out by a doctor. Having a simple fibroadenoma may raise your risk of breast cancer, compared with women without fibroadenomas. But if yours was complex, it might mean a slightly higher risk of breast cancer later on. Unless you have other things that make breast cancer more likely, like close family members with the disease, your odds are still low. Either way, keep up with your regular checkups, and ask your doctor which screening tests you need and when.", "question": "Who gets fibroadenomas?", "answer": ["Fibroadenomas are very common.

But your baby needs your help to keep stings and bites at bay. What works? What's safe for infants? The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) is clear: Bug repellents -- even the DEET-free ones -- are not safe for newborns. Since you can't use lotions and sprays on the very small, the best way to keep your baby from becoming a bug buffet is by avoiding bugs in the first place. Stay in. Bugs, especially mosquitoes, are most active at dawn and dusk. Keep your baby indoors during those hours to lower his bite risk. Defend your house. Make sure your windows and doors have screens to keep bugs from flying or crawling inside. Cover with clothes. Dress your baby so bugs don't have any access to skin. Loose-fitting long sleeves and pants Socks A hat Skip the bright, flowery prints. Bugs are attracted to those. Protect with a net. Use a fitted mesh net over carriers and strollers when you take your baby outdoors. Drain standing water. Look around your house for soggy sites, like: Planters Birdbaths Wading pools Drill holes in tire swings to keep water from collecting. Change your pets' water bowls regularly. Skip the scents. Many bugs love the smell of perfumes, hairsprays, and scented soaps. Use fragrance-free products on your baby (and yourself when you're with your baby) so you're less attractive to insects. Avoid bug hangouts. Flower gardens, garbage cans, piles of dead leaves, and bushes are all popular places for bug parties, so steer clear. As for bug zappers, don't bother. They don't work and may even invite more insects over. Once your baby is a little older, you can add repellent sprays and lotions to your bug-fighting kit. According to the CDC, insect repellent is the best way to protect your baby from mosquito bites -- as long as you use it correctly. Repellents also protect from other biting bugs like ticks, fleas, chiggers, and biting flies. But they don't work for stinging bugs, like wasps, bees, and hornets. Research says repellents with these active ingredients work the longest: DEET I5353 Picaridin When you use DEET, choose products with less than 30%. And the less time your baby will be outside, the lower the concentration of DEET you should use. Neither the natural repellent oil of lemon eucalyptus ( OLE) nor its lab-made version called PMD is safe for kids under 3 years old. Other repellents made with plant essential oils, such as citronella, cedar, and soybean, can sometimes work. They aren't as long-lasting, though, and they can irritate your baby's skin. Whether you choose sprays, liquids, creams, or sticks to use on your baby: Always read the directions on the package. Apply it to your hands first, then rub it on your baby's skin.

S. have migraine. Yet despite how common these painful, throbbing headaches are, treatment often remains a challenge. Migraine headaches are complex and still not completely understood. Certain nerves cells and brain chemicals play a role. When blood vessels in your brain get inflamed and swollen, it sets many other changes in motion. In addition to that throbbing pain in your head, you could have problems with your vision, feel very sensitive to noise and light, have diarrhea, or throw up. Every person with migraine has different symptoms. Everyone's triggers are different too, although some common ones include lack of sleep, certain foods, and stress. As doctors learn more about migraine and what parts of the brain are involved, they're finding better ways to prevent these headaches. Right now, there are two methods. Acute treatments: These drugs stop a headache after it starts. A group of drugs called ergots are the oldest treatments for migraine. Triptans, a newer drug, work the same way as ergots but are more powerful. They affect the release of certain brain chemicals and block pain pathways in your brain. Still, these drugs aren't for everyone. If you have uncontrolled high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, a history of strokes, and other heart problems, you probably can't take them. There are risks if you're pregnant. Your doctor will discuss them with you. If you have frequent attacks, your doctor may prescribe a drug to reduce the number of migraines you have. It could also help any acute drugs you take work better. Drugs used to prevent migraines include: Antidepressants: amitriptyline and venlafaxine ( Effexor) Anti-seizure drugs: gabapentin ( Neurontin), topiramate ( Qudexy XR, Topamax, Trokendi XR) and valproate ( Depakote) Beta-blockers: metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol CGRP Inhibitors: erenumab ( Aimovig), fremanezumab ( Ajovy), and galcanezumab-gnlm ( Emgality) Although they can offer help, some of these medications were made to treat other health problems. Their effect on migraines was discovered by chance. Some work better for some people than for others, and side effects are common. There are also several devices which can prevent migraines: Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS): During this treatment, you'll hold a small device called Spring TMS to the back of your head. It sends a split-second pulse which interrupts abnormal electrical activity caused by migraine, thus aborts the migraine. Transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation ( TSNS): Cefaly uses transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation and is worn as a headband on the forehead and turned on daily for 20 minutes to prevent migraine from developing. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator (n VS): gamma Core is a n VS and works by being placed placed over the vagus nerve in the neck. It releases a mild electrical stimulation to the nerve's fibers to relieve pain. Doctors keep looking for drugs that do a better job of stopping migraines before they even start. Some treatments in the pipeline include: EP4 receptor antagonists: Prostaglandins are hormones that boost inflammation throughout your body. They're also believed to play a role in migraines. Clinical trials are under way to test drugs that block prostaglandins in people. Although new drugs are on the way to prevent migraines, research continues to show that natural, drug-free techniques help, too. After all, stress is the most common trigger. Studies show that people who learn to better deal with their worries actually start to have fewer migraines. You can try: Biofeedback: This type of therapy teaches you to be aware of how your body reacts to stress, whether that's tense muscles, a fast heart rate, or cold, clammy hands. A trained professional teaches you how to change that response and calm down. Studies show that people who use biofeedback have 55% fewer migraines. This therapy may work even better when you also take medicine that prevents headaches. Progressive muscle relaxation ( PMR): This relaxation technique helps stop your body's response to stress before it triggers a migraine. A therapist will show you to tightly contract, then fully release, each of your muscles. He'll also teach you to deepen and slow your breathing. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT): A psychologist can help you learn how your thoughts and habits affect your migraines. She'll also teach you to change the way your body reacts to the pain you feel during an attack.", "question": "How can tonabersat help prevent migraines?", "answer": ["They affect the release of certain brain chemicals and block pain pathways in your brain."], "generated_answer": "Tonabersat is a natural supplement that can help prevent migraines.

The earliest known uses of the drug can be traced back to the Greek physician Hippocrates in the fifth century BC. He used powder extracted from the bark of willows to treat pain and reduce fever. For a variety of reasons, some people intentionally ingest poisons or poison others. Some reasons include: Suicide Gaining personal attention Child abuse Aspirin poisoning can also be accidental and was once the most common cause of accidental poisoning of children. Safety precautions such as child-resistant packaging has helped make it less common. Inappropriate dosing in both children and elderly people is one of the reasons accidental aspirin poisonings continue to happen. Hundreds of medications -- both over-the-counter and prescription medicines -- contain aspirin or aspirin-like substances. Unintentional poisoning can result if these medications are taken in combination, in inappropriate doses, or over a long time period. This is especially likely to occur in older people with chronic health problems. The earliest symptoms of acute aspirin poisoning may include ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and impaired hearing. More clinically significant signs and symptoms may include rapid breathing (hyperventilation), vomiting, dehydration, fever, double vision, and feeling faint. Later signs of aspirin poisoning, or signs of more significant poisoning, can include drowsiness or confusion, bizarre behavior, unsteady walking, and coma. The abnormal breathing caused by aspirin poisoning is usually rapid and deep. Vomiting may occur 3-8 hours after taking too much aspirin. Serious dehydration may occur from hyperventilation, vomiting, and fever. If you have been taking aspirin and begin to have ringing in your ears, call your doctor to see if the medication should be stopped or the dosage reduced.. For all other symptoms, call 911 (or the local emergency phone number) immediately. Serious symptoms include the following: Agitation, fever, convulsions, collapse, confusion, coma Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Rapid breathing Wheezing Nausea and vomiting Bleeding Hallucinations Drowsiness The doctor will take a history and perform a physical examination to look for evidence of poisoning. The doctor will order laboratory tests to look for damage to organ systems that can be harmed by aspirin overdose and, depending on the timing, also to check for the level of aspirin in the bloodstream. The doctor will make sure you are able to breathe and will check vital signs including body temperature. The doctor will check alertness by asking you to respond to questions. If you are unconscious, the doctor will give oxygen and perhaps use machines to help you breathe. Blood will be taken for lab testing. One blood test will measure the amount of salicylate, the active ingredient in aspirin, in your blood. Sometimes the blood level of salicylate can increase over time even though an individual has not taken any more aspirin. This may indicate the person has taken coated tablets or sustained-release tablets, which release salicylate into the bloodstream slowly. The doctor will make treatment decisions based on the dose of active ingredient ingested, the time over which it was ingested, your age, the symptoms you are experiencing, and your acid-base status. Acid-base status is the balance of acid and base in the blood. Aspirin may change this balance quickly, so the doctor will monitor this to guide treatment. Call 911 immediately if a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the victim is unconscious, having convulsions, not breathing, or is otherwise seriously ill. If the person who took the aspirin is not having symptoms, do not wait to see if symptoms develop. Call the local poison control center immediately. It is a good idea to post the telephone number of the local poison control center near the phone. This information can be found at: American Association of Poison Control Centers. Or call (800) 222-1222 if you have a poisoning emergency. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emergency department staff will want the following information: Is the person conscious? Is the person breathing? What medications were taken? Try to locate the medicine container. What is the medicine's name and how many milligrams (mg) is each pill? How much of the medicine did the person take and when was it taken? Was the medicine taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals? How old is the person who took the medicine? What are the current symptoms? What medical conditions does the person have? Although ipecac syrup was used in the past to make the victim vomit, it is rarely recommended today and is not usually appropriate in aspirin poisoning. Causing vomiting can be very dangerous in the case of an altered mental status or convulsions. Doctors may use gastric lavage, or pumping out the stomach contents, to try to prevent further absorption of the aspirin into the body. Dialysis is also sometimes used to reduce the amount of salicylate in the body. Activated charcoal: To prevent more absorption, the doctor may give activated charcoal to absorb the salicylate from the stomach. A laxative may be given with the activated charcoal to move the mixture through the gastrointestinal system more rapidly. People who have been severely poisoned may be given repeated doses of activated charcoal. IV fluids: Dehydration occurs early in aspirin poisoning. To correct dehydration, the doctor will start an IV to provide fluids. The doctor will also work to correct imbalances in the body's blood chemistries. Alkaline diuresis: This is a way to reduce the amount of salicylate in the body. Alkaline diuresis is the process of giving a person who has been poisoned compounds that alter the chemistry of the blood and urine in a way that allows the kidneys to remove more salicylate. Specifically, sodium bicarbonate is given via IV to make the blood and urine less acidic (more alkaline). This encourages the kidneys to capture more salicylate that can leave the body through the urine. Sometimes, other compounds, such as potassium, also have to be given to help with this process. The emergency physician may have to perform other procedures or give other medications as supportive care in the case of a dangerous aspirin overdose. These actions may include the following: Placing a breathing tube (intubation) and assisting breathing with a ventilator for a person who is in a coma, cannot protect his or her own airway, or needs mechanical breathing Placing of a catheter into the bladder to monitor urine output and frequently check the acidity (p H) of the urine Giving other medicines as needed to treat agitation, convulsions (seizures), or other complications of aspirin poisoning A person with serious symptoms may be admitted to an intensive care unit. If the overdose was intentional, psychiatric services should be provided. A person with minor symptoms such as ringing in the ears or nausea may be admitted to the hospital for further observation. The following people, will likely be admitted to the hospital regardless of salicylate levels: Infants and elderly persons People with long-term salicylism People who ingested sustained-release products Psychiatric and medical follow-up may be recommended. Careful monitoring of medication will also be recommended. Tests to monitor kidney function may be done periodically after hospital discharge, especially in elderly people. Prescription medications should be used according to your doctor's and pharmacist's directions. Never take a medicine prescribed for someone else. To protect children from accidental drug overdose, all medications should be stored in containers with child-resistant caps. All medications should be out of sight and out of reach of children, preferably in a locked cabinet. Take suicidal threats seriously. Never give or take medication in the dark. Always tell the doctor of any previous side effects or adverse reactions to medication as well as any new or unusual symptoms that occur. Never take more than the recommended or prescribed dose of a medication. Inform your doctor about all the medications you are taking. Be sure to mention over-the-counter medications. Recovery is likely if the proper treatment is given and the dose of aspirin taken is not too high. With chronic aspirin poisoning outcomes are less predictable. With acute aspirin poisoning, severity and outcome depend on many factors including the dose taken and the person's body weight.

Procedures can include: Removing excess skin Removing or altering neck muscles Liposuction to remove excess fat Botox injections to address problems with fullness or \"bands\" Kybella injections to remove excess fat under the chin Other neck lifting techniques involve lasers, ultrasound and radiofrequency devices, intense pulsed light, and fillers. You must be in good health to get a neck lift. You'll consult with your surgeon in advance. For that meeting, have your goals in mind for what you want to change. Here are some of the most common concerns that are addressed with a neck lift: Turkey wattle neck Excess fat Too much skin During your consultation, you should go over your goals and learn about the options: Turkey Wattle: Your surgeon may recommend surgery, which involves making cuts under your chin or behind your ears or both to access a neck muscle called the platysma. Sometimes, that may even mean removing some muscle. Newer procedures may let your surgeon make smaller cuts and use an endoscope (a small camera attached to a thin tube) to complete your surgery. Make sure you ask your surgeon for all your options during your consultation. You and your surgeon will discuss what type of anesthesia to use, depending on your level of comfort. If you want to remain asleep during the procedure, you should request general anesthesia. Otherwise, your surgeon can use local anesthesia with sedation. It's up to you, however, to make that choice. Instead of surgery or in addition to it, Botox injections can relax parts of the platysma that are responsible for the \"band\" appearance or look of fullness. Those injections can be done in 15 minutes on an outpatient basis, meaning no overnight stay. Liposuction : During liposuction, your surgeon will make a small cut below your chin and remove excess fat. If you are also getting other procedures, it is very common for cosmetic surgeons to begin with liposuction. You will be able to determine this with your doctor during your consultation. If this is the only procedure you're getting, you should plan on the operation lasting up to an hour. Your incisions will be stitched and bandaged. It's important to make sure you understand and follow your doctor's instructions on properly caring for the stitches and bandage. Too Much Skin on Your Neck: Your surgeon will trim parts of the skin and lift it into place, securing it with tissue glue or stitches. This takes about two to four hours, depending on the complexity of your procedure. Again, your type of anesthesia will depend on your own personal comfort level. Your surgeon will fit you with a compression bandage that you will have to wear for at least one week unless instructed otherwise. Your surgeon will tell you to avoid certain medications and supplements before your surgery to reduce the risk of excessive bleeding. Tell your doctor about any drug allergies you have. Although it's very rare, you could have an allergic reaction to the anesthesia. If you smoke, you will need to quit for at least four weeks before the surgery and four weeks after. Don't just plan to cut down. Not smoking for this time period is necessary for proper healing. Eat a healthy diet. That will help your body heal. You should plan to take at least one week off from work. Ask your doctor exactly how much time off you'll need. Set up an area in your home for recovery. The area should have: Ice packs Gauze and towels Thermometer Supply of comfortable, loose clothing (preferably button-down shirts or blouses that do not have to be pulled over your head and neck) Petroleum jelly and antibacterial ointment Telephone within reaching distance of where you'll be lying or sitting most of the time Pillows that will allow you to keep your head in a comfortable position Someone who can stay with you at least the first 24 hours after surgery On the day of surgery, wear loose, comfortable clothing. Wear a button-down blouse or shirt that you don't have to pull over your head and neck. You will have swelling and bruising that can last for several days after a neck lift. You may feel tightness or tingling and different sensations, including burning or pulling. You also will experience numbness. These are all normal in the first few weeks following surgery and should not be cause for concern. As with any surgery, infection is possible. Take your temperature. At the first sign of a fever, contact your doctor. If you have unusual discharge, such as pus, from the surgery site, contact your doctor immediately. Recovering from a neck lift takes time. Most people can return to work in 10 to 14 days. If you participate in sports or are physically active, you will have to wait three weeks or more to resume those activities. Give yourself time to heal to get the most benefit from the procedure. Most health insurance companies do not cover cosmetic surgery. Be clear on what, if anything, your insurance will cover before the surgery. That way, you'll know what to expect. If your procedures will correct a medical condition, tell your health insurer before the surgery. Your surgeon can write a letter detailing your case. With certain insurance plans, cosmetic or plastic surgery can affect future coverage. It can also affect your premiums. Make sure you ask your health insurer about that before you get the procedure, so you know what to expect.", "question": "How long does it take to recover from a neck lift?", "answer": ["Recovering from a neck lift takes time.

When chronic migraine headaches begin, you might notice that your headaches are less severe but happen more often, until they happen every day. This change may be linked to daily use of pain relievers. Some people with chronic migraine headaches have severe pain along with nausea and vomiting, much like other types of migraines. Often, it's hard to tell the difference between tension headaches and chronic migraine headaches. Because chronic migraine headaches are tough to diagnose, many people may get the wrong treatment. And because the headaches happen every day, many people tend to take too many pain relievers, both prescription and over-the-counter, using these drugs daily even when they don't have a headache. This means the person could build up a tolerance to the drugs. Plus, taking a lot of pain relievers with caffeine can lead to medication overuse headaches. In many cases, people who have chronic migraine headaches have other health problems, such as high blood pressure and depression, which complicate treatment.

If there's a problem with your how your lower intestinal tract (colon, rectum, and anus) are working, you have âfunctional constipation.â But if that's not the case, you could have âsecondary constipationâ -- that's when it's brought on by a medical problem or a medication you take. Some medications can cause constipation as a side effect. They include: Heartburn medications like aluminum or calcium antacids Certain depression medications Calcium channel blockers that control blood pressure Diuretics (water pills) Drugs to lessen or treat muscle spasms in your gut Iron pills to treat some kinds of anemia Epilepsy medications Painkillers such as morphine, codeine or other opioids If your doctor thinks it's something you're taking, talk to him about your other options. You may have something else going on that's slowing down your digestion. Several conditions are known to cause such problems: Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS) causes belly pain, gas, bloating, and a change in bathroom habits. If you have IBS with constipation ( IBS- C), you may notice that your symptoms flare and then normal bowel habits return. Sometimes, bouts of diarrhea or loose stools happen, too. Diabetes: Constipation is common for people with this condition. It's thought that diabetes may affect nerves in the colon, which can slow down the movement of stool. Hypothyroidism: This happens when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough hormones. This can slow down many of your body functions, including your bowels. Neurological diseases: Constipation is more common in people with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal injuries, and the neuromuscular disease muscular dystrophy. People with these conditions can have problems relaxing muscles in the pelvic floor which makes it hard to push stool out. Or their colons may work more slowly, leading to fewer bowel movements. Colon cancer: Constipation and/or a change in the color or shape of your stool can be a sign of this cancer. If it's red, maroon, or very dark, you could have blood in your stool. Crohn's disease: This causes irritation and swelling in any part of the digestive tract. If it happens in your rectum, you may get constipated. Diverticulosis: This happens when small pouches bulge out from the wall of your colon. Some people don't have symptoms. But you may have bloating, cramping, diarrhea, and constipation. These symptoms may get worse if the pouches get swollen or infected. That's a problem called diverticulitis. Pregnancy: About 2 in 5 pregnant women get constipated. It's usually more of a problem during the first few months. When you're expecting, your body makes more of the hormone progesterone. It acts as a muscle relaxant.

Get familiar with some simple rules for taking care of your healing wound. Your doctor will give you exact instructions on when and how to change it. Most wounds don't need one after a few days, but if you keep the area covered, it may help protect the cut from injury and it may heal faster. If you do keep a bandage on, change it every day. Wash your hands well with soap and water before and after. You can clean the skin around the cut with a soft cloth or gauze pad. First, soak the cloth or gauze in soapy water or in a mixture of sterile water and salt. Then, gently wipe or dab the skin around the wound. Don't use skin cleansers, antibacterial soaps, alcohol, iodine, or peroxide. They can damage the skin in the wound and delay healing. Also, don't put on any lotion, cream, or herbal product unless you've checked with your doctor first. Your doctor will tell you how to wash out your wound. He may say to fill a syringe with salt water or mild soapy water. This will help rinse away any pus that's draining out. Last, pat it dry with clean gauze or a clean cloth. Don't let it get wet for the first 24 hours after your surgery. So skip a bath or shower on the first day, though a sponge bath is usually OK. You might be able to shower by the second day, but it depends on the type of operation you had, so check with your doctor. Once you have the go-ahead to get your whole body wet, it's better to shower than to take a bath. That's because soaking your wound can soften it and may cause it to open up again. Ask if you need to put on a waterproof dressing. Don't put soap or any other bath products directly onto your wound while it's still healing. After you shower, gently pat the area dry with a clean towel. It's best to avoid movement that affects the area surrounding your wound. That way, you'll lower your risk of pulling the cut apart. Your doctor might tell you to stay away from lifting and some exercises and sports for about a month after surgery. If your cut opens up, call your doctor. Replace the bloody bandage with a new one. If you apply pressure directly to the cut for a few minutes, it will usually put an end to the bleeding. Call your doctor if it doesn't stop right away. If you have the dissolving type of stitches, you won't need to get them pulled out. They disappear on their own in 7 to 10 days. Your doctor can remove other kinds of stitches or staples in 5 to 21 days, depending on the surgery you had. Sunburn can darken a healing scar and make it more noticeable. For the first 6 months after your operation, try to keep it out of sunlight. When you're outside in daylight, cover it with tape or put on sunscreen. Call if you see any signs that you're getting an infection around your wound. Some things to watch out for: Pain that gets worse Redness or swelling Bleeding or oozing pus Increasing drainage from the wound (may become thick, tan, green, or yellow) A bad smell Your wound looks larger, deeper, dried out, or dark.

This process is called staging. Knowing the stage of your disease is crucial because it will help you and your doctor choose the best course of treatment. Here's a look at the options for each stage. Keep in mind that no one can say for sure how your cancer will respond. Every person is different, and so is every cancer. Your doctor will make changes along the way to find what works best. How It's Defined The cancer is only in the lining of your airways. Treatments Surgery: If your health is good overall, surgery is probably all you need. Depending on where the tumor is, your surgeon will suggest one of these procedures: Wedge resection: Cut out the tumor and a small amount of normal lung tissue. Segmental resection (segmentectomy): Take out the part of the lung where the tumor is. Sleeve resection: Remove a lobe of the lung and a part of the airway. Lobectomy: Cut out an entire lobe of the lung. ( The right lung is divided into three lobes; the left lung has two lobes.) Most surgeons prefer this option since it offers the best chance for a cure. Pneumonectomy: Take out the entire lung. This might sound extreme, but you can live a normal life with only one lung. Photodynamic therapy ( PDT): This process uses a drug called a photosensitizer and a certain type of light to create a form of oxygen that kills nearby cells. It can help shrink tumors without the side effects of other drugs. Brachytherapy: This is a form of internal radiation where radioactive material is put into a tumor or into an airway next to a tumor. How It's Defined In stage IA, the tumor is no larger than 3 centimeters (about 1 1/4 inches) across and hasn't spread to any other tissues or lymph nodes. In stage IB, it's no more than 4 centimeters and has spread to the main bronchus of the lung's lining, or both. Treatments Surgery: If you're in good health, surgery may be all you need. Based on the tumor's size and placement and how well your lungs work, your surgeon may suggest one of these procedures. Sleeve resection Segmentectomy or wedge resection (for tumors smaller than 2 centimeters across) Lobectomy Chemotherapy: With any of these surgeries, nearby lymph nodes are also removed to see if the cancer has spread. If your medical team feels your cancer could come back, they'll probably suggest you get chemo after surgery to destroy any leftover cancer cells. You might hear this called adjuvant chemotherapy. You could take a chemo drug by mouth or get it in a vein. Radiation: If you're not healthy enough for surgery, your doctor may go with this therapy. It uses powerful X-rays to kill cancer cells. You may hear the doctor call it external radiation. Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA): This is a procedure where heat produced by radio waves kills cancer cells. How It's Defined The tumor is between 3 and 7 centimeters across, or it has spread to your lymph nodes, or both. Treatments Chemotherapy: Your doctor may want to do chemo (sometimes paired with radiation) before surgery to shrink the tumor. He might call this neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Even if your doctor doesn't find cancer cells during surgery, he might suggest chemo afterward just in case cancer cells were left behind. Surgery: If you're healthy enough, the doctor will likely recommend one of the following: Lobectomy Sleeve resection Pneumonectomy After surgery, your doctor will check the tissue he removed to see if cancer cells are at the edges. If so, you may need another operation to remove more cancer cells. Radiation: If you're not healthy enough for surgery, you may get radiation instead. How It's Defined Cancer is found in the lung and in the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest. Stage III has three subtypes: How It's Defined If the cancer has spread only to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest where it began, it's called stage IIIA. Treatments Chemotherapy and radiation: If you can stand the side effects, treatment usually starts with chemo. It might be combined with radiation. Surgery: If you're healthy enough and your doctor thinks there's a good chance he can remove any cancer that remains, he may suggest surgery. In some cases, it may be his first choice of treatment. It's often followed by chemotherapy and sometimes radiation. The type of surgery depends on the size and location of the tumor, how far the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes, and whether you've had surgery before. How It's Defined The cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the opposite lung or in your neck. These cancers can't be completely removed by surgery. Treatments Chemotherapy with radiation: Again, treatment depends on your overall health and how you can handle the treatments. If you're in fairly good health, chemo and radiation might improve your condition. Radiation or chemotherapy: If you can't handle the combo treatment, you'll probably get radiation therapy alone. Chemo by itself is less common. Clinical trials: These cancers can be difficult to treat, so you may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial of newer treatments. How It's Defined The cancer has spread to both lungs, to fluid in the area surrounding the lungs, or to other organs. Treatments: Chemotherapy and radiation: A cancer that's spread to distant sites in your body can be hard to cure. As long as you're in fairly good health and can handle the side effects, treatments like chemotherapy and radiation can ease your symptoms and help you live longer. Immunotherapy: This involves drugs that help your body's own immune system find and destroy cancer cells. Targeted therapy: A test can tell your doctor if your cancer will respond to one of these new treatments. These drugs only attack cancer cells and do little damage to healthy cells nearby. They don't work for everyone, and some are still in trial phase and not on the market yet. If there's one that might work for you, your doctor can help you find out more about how to get into a clinical trial. Photodynamic therapy: Doctors use light to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Stent: Lung tumors that have grown into an airway can cause trouble breathing or other problems. Your doctor puts a hard silicone or metal tube called a stent into the airway to hold it open.", "question": "What is stage IV lung cancer?", "answer": ["How It's Defined The cancer has spread to both lungs, to fluid in the area surrounding the lungs, or to other organs."], "generated_answer": "Stage IV lung cancer is the most advanced stage of the disease.

Your child can't sit still for any length of time. She doesn't follow instructions well. She's unorganized and forgetful at school. It's possible she has ADHD. Maybe you make careless mistakes at work and keep losing your keys. Is it ADHD if you have a hard time keeping up with presentations in meetings? Before you jump to any conclusions, consider what else could be causing these kinds of behaviors. It may not be an illness after all, and it may be something you can easily fix. Your brain needs water to work. When you're low on fluids, your brain's chemistry gets thrown off, and your memory and your ability to think clearly and make decisions suffer. Drink a glass of water when you feel like your thoughts aren't clicking. To help keep your body hydrated, have one with every meal and at least one between meals. Drink up before, after, and while you exercise, too. How long has it been since you've eaten? If you're moody, cranky, drowsy, or confused, it may be because you have low blood sugar. A healthy meal or snack -- like a spinach salad with salmon and avocado, or a handful of walnuts -- could help you concentrate. Eating a lot of sweets, though, could slow down your brain. A little caffeine can help you focus, but too much can make you jittery and restless. You may not realize how much you're getting. It's found in chocolate and some headache medicines, as well as coffee, black and green teas, sodas, and energy drinks. And having caffeine later in the day might cause trouble sleeping, which can also make you distracted. If you've been overdoing the caffeine, back off slowly to avoid unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Let's face it: There usually aren't enough hours in the day. And buying yourself some time by staying up late or getting up early may sound like a solution. But when you don't get enough sleep, your judgment, mood, and ability to learn and remember suffer. You're more likely to make mistakes. Allow your brain to rest and repair itself. A regular schedule, a soothing bedtime ritual, and comfortable bedroom conditions can help you fall asleep faster. To improve the quality of your sleep, get some exercise during the day and limit how much you eat and drink right before bed. Try cutting back on or avoiding naps to encourage nighttime slumber. Stress is your body's reaction when it feels threatened in some way. Your child could have trouble with a subject at school, get into a fight with a friend, or pick up on tension at home. Perhaps you're trying to make a deadline or are worried about an unexpected expense. It's normal to be thinking about what's bothering you rather than what you should be paying attention to, but being distracted can lead to trouble. Long-term stress can also hurt memory. To clear your head, start by recognizing that you're upset or anxious. Admitting it will actually help your body relax. Breathe, and give yourself some encouragement that things will work out. Take a walk, go for a run, or do some yoga to ease the tension and make you feel more alert. This can be really stressful for kids, especially when it happens through email, texting, a chat room, or on a web site. It's hard to avoid cyberbullying, and it's easy for others to pile on and amplify it. The effects of bullying can show up in a kid's grades, attitude, and health. Talk to your child about what's going on. If it is bullying, most schools have prevention programs and anti-bullying policies. Find out what these policies are and check that they're being enforced. Give your child positive support to build their self-esteem and confidence and to take away the bully's power. Help them figure out how to respond when it happens and what you and they can do to stop it. Some children, especially those who are gifted, can become easily bored and impulsive, especially at school. They'll stare out the window or doze off in class. A gifted child can also become bossy and may not make friends easily because they're seen as a \"know-it-all.\" They dislike routine, resist direction, and can be disruptive. They'll look for something to keep their minds occupied. Meet with your child's teacher to talk about the classroom setting and schoolwork. They may have more insight into what's behind the behavior, and they might be able to make adjustments to keep your child interested. Problems at school or work, poor memory, bad judgment, and moodiness are just a few symptoms of drug or alcohol misuse. The key things to look for are big changes in how someone looks, acts, and interacts with others. If you think this might be the issue, reach out to someone -- a counselor, social worker, doctor, or clergy member -- who can help you help yourself, your child, or loved one. Drug addiction can be treated with behavior therapy, sometimes medication, and support.

Keep these things in mind before making the decision. A medication break can ease side effects. A lack of appetite, weight loss, sleep troubles, headaches, and stomach pain are common side effects of ADHD medication. It may boost your child's growth.

Together, these conditions affect millions of Americans. Fortunately, these disorders are treatable, and those affected can lead normal, productive lives. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress, but when it takes on a life of its own it becomes an unhealthy, generalized reaction that affects the body and mind. Symptoms can include rapid heartbeat, aches and pains, and muscle tension. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 18% of adults in the United States suffer from an anxiety disorder in any given year, and anxiety disorders are prevalent in 25% of children ages 13 to 18. Like depression, anxiety is thought to arise from a combination of both genetic and environmental factors. Although anxiety is not always present in depressive disorders, most of the time it lurks beneath the surface. But true depression differs from an anxiety disorder in that a depressed mood is typically its most obvious symptom, whereas anxiety is the primary sign of an authentic anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders include: Generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD) Panic disorder Specific phobias Social anxiety disorder Previously, two other conditions -- obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) -- had been classified by the American Psychiatric Association as being subtypes of anxiety disorders. However, in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5), each of these conditions is now classified as its own separate type of disorder. Anxiety disorders affect women twice as frequently as they do men. And many studies show that people with depression often experience symptoms of an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder that's left untreated can cause unnecessary suffering and impairment for both the person who has one and the person's family. People with generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD) are filled with greatly exaggerated worry and tension -- even though there is usually nothing beyond ordinary concerns to worry about. These individuals anticipate disaster and ruminate about their health, their finances, their work, their relationships and family problems. To make a diagnosis of GAD, excessive worrying and anxiety have to occur more days than not for at least 6 months. The person is unable to control the worry and may have other symptoms including: Difficulty concentrating Fatigue Irritability Muscle tension Restlessness Sleep disturbance This anxiety disorder is not related to substance abuse or a medical condition. It occurs independently. Panic disorder is another type of generalized anxiety disorder that often co-exists with depression. Panic disorder affects 6 million Americans every year, most often young adults. Panic disorder involves the sudden onset of overwhelming fear and terror. The person may also experience: Chest pain Choking Difficulty breathing Dizziness Gastrointestinal distress Headache Shortness of breath Sweaty palms Tachycardia (an unusually rapid heart beat) Trembling The person feels like he or she is either going to faint, have a heart attack and die, or go crazy. For somebody to be diagnosed with panic attack, at least four of the following symptoms need to be present: Chest pain Choking sensation Dizziness Extreme sweating Fast heartbeat Fear of dying Feeling of losing control Feelings of unreality or being detached from oneself Hot flashes or chills Nausea Numbness Shakiness Shortness of breath These symptoms are often accompanied by worry over the implications of the attack -- like fear of death from a heart attack -- and altered behavior, like avoiding a particular place because of the attack. Specific phobias are the most common type of anxiety disorder. They involve an unreasonable or irrational fear of something that poses little or no real danger. The fear can be of a situation, object, or event. If people with phobias can't avoid what they fear, then it immediately results in a marked anxiety response. This response can include rapid heartbeat, nausea, or profuse sweating. Phobias are common and strike one out of 10 Americans, with women twice as likely to have a phobia as men. Social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, is a psychological condition that causes an overwhelming fear of situations that require interacting with another person or performing in front of others. Unlike being shy around strangers or nervous before a performance, social anxiety is a fear that you might humiliate yourself with your actions or speech in public. Social phobia is common. It affects more than 15 million people in any given year. It often begins in childhood and rarely develops after age 25. People with social phobia are often aware that their fears are irrational, but they are unable to ease or erase these fears. The symptoms of social phobia are much the same as symptoms for other anxiety disorders. They include: Difficulty talking Dry mouth Intense sweating Nausea Racing heart Trembling or shaking Like with other anxiety illnesses, symptoms can be tolerable or so severe that they become socially debilitating. Schizophrenia is a type of major psychotic illness that is usually marked by an inability to distinguish the real from the imaginary, confused or jumbled thoughts, and hallucinations. Feelings of emptiness and sadness may be a symptom of the disorder, but schizophrenia and depression are different on a neurobiological level. About half of people with schizophrenia may develop a major depressive episode at some point in their lives, but depression is not considered an enduring or hallmark feature of schizophrenia. Eating disorders frequently occur with depression and anxiety disorders. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, eating disorders are marked by extremes. They occur when someone severely reduces food intake or overeats to the extreme. Treatment may include antidepressants. The two most common types of eating disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Eating disorders are more common among teenage girls and women. These disorders often get worse the longer they go untreated. The lack of nutrition associated with eating disorders can harm the body's organs and, in severe cases, lead to death. People with anorexia purposefully starve themselves, despite their hunger. They tend to excel in sports, school, and work -- often seeking perfection. Some people with anorexia stop eating in order to gain a feeling of control over their lives. Others may do so to rebel against parents and other loved ones. The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa requires that a person weigh at least 15% less than his or her ideal body weight. It is estimated that up to 3.7% of females will suffer from anorexia at some time during their lives. Anorexia is primarily a food restriction disorder. However, it is not uncommon for people with anorexia to purge, or empty themselves, through vomiting and abuse of laxatives, enemas, and diuretics. People with bulimia nervosa eat large amounts of food all at once and then vomit. The vomiting may occur multiple times during a day. The vomiting is triggered by a fear of weight gain or stomach discomfort. People with bulimia also use laxatives, diuretics, and vigorous exercise to purge themselves. In order for a person to be diagnosed with bulimia, this behavior must occur at least twice a week for three months in a row. Although people with bulimia are often underweight, they may also have a normal body weight. It is estimated that bulimia will affect up to 4.2% of females at some point in their lives. Substance use disorders -- which are linked to depression -- involve the use of drugs or alcohol to the point of social, financial, legal, occupational, or physical harm. Millions of Americans abuse drugs or alcohol for a variety of reasons, among them to cope with stress and anxiety. Biological factors, such as a genetic tendency, may also play a role. Substance abuse may include some of the following symptoms: Continuing to use the substance despite the knowledge of its harmful effects on one's physical and mental condition Finding it impossible to discontinue use despite making efforts Giving up or reducing social, recreational, and work-related activities because of substance use Increasing the amount of a substance used over time Spending lots of time and effort either getting the substance or recovering from its use Needing to increase the amounts of a substance in order to become intoxicated, or experiencing a diminished effect from continued use of the same amount. Taking more of the substance to ease withdrawal symptoms Withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, shaking, insomnia, agitation, hallucination, and sweating following a reduction in the amount of a substance taken There are varied approaches to treating people with substance abuse plus depression. Some will need detoxification in a hospital or a clinic. Rehabilitation may include one-on-one counseling, group counseling, and support groups. Antidepressant medicines -- in combination with education to help people address and conquer the emotions that cause them to abuse drugs or alcohol -- can also be effective.", "question": "How many adults in the U.S. have anxiety disorder?", "answer": ["According to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 18% of adults in the United States suffer from an anxiety disorder in any given year, and anxiety disorders are prevalent in 25% of children ages 13 to 18.

Moles can appear anywhere on the skin, alone or in groups. Most moles appear in early childhood and during the first 25 years of a person's life. It is normal to have between 10-40 moles by adulthood. As the years pass, moles usually change slowly, becoming raised and/or changing color. Sometimes, hairs develop in the mole. Some moles may not change at all, while others may slowly disappear over time. Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. These cells are called melanocytes, and they make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. Moles may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, and during pregnancy. Congenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. Congenital nevi occur in about one in 100 people. These moles are slightly more likely to develop into melanoma (cancer) than are moles that appear after birth. A mole or freckle should be checked if it has a diameter of more than a pencil eraser or any characteristics of the ABCDEs of melanoma (see below). Dysplastic nevi are moles that are generally larger than average (larger than a pencil eraser) and irregular in shape. They tend to have uneven color with dark brown centers and lighter, uneven edges. These nevi are somewhat more likely to become melanoma. In fact, people who have 10 or more dysplastic nevi have a 12 times higher chance of developing melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Any changes in a mole should be checked by a dermatologist to evaluate for skin cancer. The vast majority of moles are not dangerous. Moles that are more likely to be cancer are those that look different than other existing moles or those that first appear after age 25. If you notice changes in a mole's color, height, size, or shape, you should have a dermatologist (skin doctor) evaluate it. You also should have moles checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, or become tender or painful. Examine your skin with a mirror or ask someone to help you. Pay special attention to areas of the skin that are often exposed to the sun, such as the hands, arms, chest, neck, face, ears, legs, and back. If a mole does not change over time, there is little reason for concern. If you see any signs of change in an existing mole, if you have a new mole, or if you want a mole to be removed for cosmetic reasons, talk to your dermatologist. The following ABCDEs are important characteristics to consider when examining moles. If a mole displays any of the signs listed below, have it checked immediately by a dermatologist. It could be cancerous. Asymmetry. One half of the mole does not match the other half. Border. The border or edges of the mole are ragged, blurred, or irregular. Color. The color of the mole is not the same throughout or has shades of tan, brown, black, blue, white, or red. Diameter. The diameter of a mole is larger than the eraser of a pencil. Evolution. The mole is changing in size, shape, or color. Melanoma is a form of skin cancer. The most common location for melanoma in men is the chest and back and in women, it is the lower leg. Melanoma is the most common cancer in young women. If a dermatologist believes a mole needs to be evaluated further, he or she will do a biopsy by shaving or cutting out the entire spot so that it can be evaluated under the microscope. This is a simple procedure. ( If the dermatologist thinks the mole might be cancerous, cutting through the mole will not cause the cancer to spread.) If the mole is found to be cancerous, the dermatologist will cut out the entire mole or scar from the biopsy site by cutting out the entire area and a rim of normal skin around it, and stitching the wound closed. A skin tag is a small flap of tissue that hangs off the skin by a connecting stalk. Skin tags are not dangerous. They are usually found on the neck, chest, back, armpits, under the breasts, or in the groin area. Skin tags appear most often in women, especially with weight gain, and in elderly people. Skin tags usually don't cause any pain. However, they can become irritated if anything, such as clothing, jewelry, or skin rubs against them. Your dermatologist can remove a skin tag by cutting it off with a scalpel or scissors, with cryosurgery (freezing it off), or with electrosurgery (burning it off with an electric current). A lentigo (plural: lentigines) is a spot on the skin that is darker (usually brown) than the surrounding skin. Lentigines are more common among whites, especially those with fair skin. Exposure to the sun seems to be the major cause of lentigines. Lentigines most often appear on parts of the body that get the most sun, including the face and hands. Some lentigines may be caused by genetics (family history) or by medical procedures such as radiation therapy. There are several methods for treating lentigines: Cryosurgery (freezing it off) Laser surgery Skin creams such as retinoids and bleaching agents The best way to prevent lentigines is to stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when outdoors, and wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat. Avoid using tanning beds. Freckles are small brown spots usually found on the face, neck, chest, and arms. Freckles are extremely common and are not a health threat. They are more often seen in the summer, especially among lighter-skinned people and people with light or red hair. Causes of freckles include genetics and exposure to the sun. Since freckles are almost always harmless, there is no need to treat them. As with many skin conditions, it's best to avoid the sun as much as possible, or use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30. This is especially important because people who freckle easily (for example, lighter-skinned people) are more likely to develop skin cancer. If you feel that your freckles are a problem or you don't like the way they look, you can cover them up with makeup or consider certain types of laser treatment, liquid nitrogen treatment or chemical peels. Seborrheic keratoses are brown or black growths usually found on the chest and back, as well as on the head. They originate from cells called keratinocytes. As they develop, seborrheic keratoses take on a warty appearance. They do not normally lead to skin cancer. The cause of seborrheic keratoses is unknown. They are seen more often as people get older. Seborrheic keratoses are harmless and are not contagious. Therefore, they don't need to be treated. If you decide to have seborrheic keratoses removed because you don't like the way they look, or because they are chronically irritated by clothing, methods for removing them include cutting them off, cryosurgery, and electrosurgery.", "question": "What is dysplastic nevi mole?", "answer": ["Dysplastic nevi are moles that are generally larger than average (larger than a pencil eraser) and irregular in shape.

Moles can appear anywhere on the skin, alone or in groups. Most moles appear in early childhood and during the first 25 years of a person's life. It is normal to have between 10-40 moles by adulthood. As the years pass, moles usually change slowly, becoming raised and/or changing color. Sometimes, hairs develop in the mole. Some moles may not change at all, while others may slowly disappear over time. Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. These cells are called melanocytes, and they make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. Moles may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, and during pregnancy. Congenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. Congenital nevi occur in about one in 100 people. These moles are slightly more likely to develop into melanoma (cancer) than are moles that appear after birth. A mole or freckle should be checked if it has a diameter of more than a pencil eraser or any characteristics of the ABCDEs of melanoma (see below). Dysplastic nevi are moles that are generally larger than average (larger than a pencil eraser) and irregular in shape. They tend to have uneven color with dark brown centers and lighter, uneven edges. These nevi are somewhat more likely to become melanoma. In fact, people who have 10 or more dysplastic nevi have a 12 times higher chance of developing melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Any changes in a mole should be checked by a dermatologist to evaluate for skin cancer. The vast majority of moles are not dangerous. Moles that are more likely to be cancer are those that look different than other existing moles or those that first appear after age 25. If you notice changes in a mole's color, height, size, or shape, you should have a dermatologist (skin doctor) evaluate it. You also should have moles checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, or become tender or painful. Examine your skin with a mirror or ask someone to help you. Pay special attention to areas of the skin that are often exposed to the sun, such as the hands, arms, chest, neck, face, ears, legs, and back. If a mole does not change over time, there is little reason for concern. If you see any signs of change in an existing mole, if you have a new mole, or if you want a mole to be removed for cosmetic reasons, talk to your dermatologist.

Staying well-hydrated can be a key part of your plan to \"get things moving\" again. Water is important for your digestion. It keeps the food you eat moving through your intestines, and it keeps your intestines smooth and flexible, too. Dehydration is one of the most common causes of chronic constipation. The food you eat makes its way from your stomach to the large intestine, or colon. If you don't have enough water in your body already, the large intestine soaks up water from your food waste. This makes you have hard stools that are difficult to pass. There are other causes of chronic constipation too, including what you eat, traveling, medicines, irritable bowel syndrome, and pregnancy. Watch the amount of fluid you drink, listen to your body, and drink more liquids during exercise and hot weather. You get dehydrated when your body gets rid of more fluids -- usually through sweating or going to the bathroom more than normal -- than it takes in. Drinking too little water during exercise, hot weather, or daily activities can also cause your body to use up its stored water. Extra fluids help keep the stool soft and easy to pass, but drinking more liquids does not cure constipation. When it comes to thirst, most experts say you should let your body be your guide. The Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board suggests that women get 91 ounces of water each day from foods and drinks and men should get 125 ounces. Remember, this recommendation includes the fluids that you take in from your food. In general, for healthy, average people, 8 cups a day is a good goal. Talk to your doctor about how much water is good for you. People with some medical conditions may need to drink less than that. Others may need more than 8 cups a day. Fruit and vegetable juices, clear soups, and herbal teas are also good sources of fluids. Stay away from alcohol. It is a diuretic, which gets rid of water from your body and leads to dehydration.

To find the best one for you, you'll work closely with a specialist called a hematologist-oncologist, a doctor with special training in blood diseases such as leukemia. The goal is to destroy cells that contain the BCR- ABL gene, which leads to too many abnormal white blood cells. Your doctor will decide on a treatment plan based on the stage of your disease. He'll likely start you off with a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI). It blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase, which is made by the BCR- ABL gene and plays a role in the growth of abnormal blood cells. Your doctor will likely prescribe a TKI such as: Bosutinib ( Bosulif) Dasatinib ( Sprycel) Imatinib ( Gleevec) Nilotinib ( Tasigna) Ponatinib ( Iclusig) Most people get a quick response from these drugs. Your doctor will likely know in 3 to 6 months if your treatment works. You may go into \"remission\" while you take a TKI. That means that the abnormal gene is no longer in your cells. It doesn't mean that you're cured, but your CML is now under control. Always tell your doctor about any new symptoms. Some side effects that you might have from a TKI are: Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Rash Headache Fatigue Lower blood cell counts Your doctor will set several goals to help him check if your treatment is doing its job. For instance, he'll look to see that you have: Normal blood cell counts with no signs of abnormal white blood cells, called a complete hematologic response. No blood or bone marrow cells that contain the \" Philadelphia\" chromosome, which creates the BCR- ABL gene. This is called a complete cytogenetic response. No sign of BCR- ABL in your blood, also called a complete molecular response. While you take TKIs, you'll get regular blood tests, including: Complete blood counts to check white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets Blood cell exams to check the percentage of abnormal blood cells Cytogenetic analysis, which looks for the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) tests to check for the BCR- ABL gene A typical schedule for testing may look something like this: During the first 3 months, you'll likely have a complete round of blood tests every 2 weeks. At 3 months, you may get a follow-up bone marrow study. After the third month, you'll have blood and bone marrow tests at least once every 6 months until you have a complete cytogenetic response. Once you have a complete cytogenetic and molecular response, you'll get a PCR test every 3-6 months and a cytogenetic analysis once every year. If your CML doesn't slow down after you are treated with two or more TKIs, your doctor may switch you to another drug such as omacetaxine mepesuccinate ( Synribo). It helps stop the growth of cancer cells. You get it as an injection. You've got some other options: Immunotherapy. It helps your immune system, your body's defense against germs, destroy the cancer. One example is a drug called interferon, which you take as an injection every day. Chemotherapy. It kills the abnormal cells in your body, but it doesn't work as well for CML as other types of leukemia. It's usually used if you're in the \"blast\" phase of the disease, a period when infections and bleeding are common and can be life-threatening. Allogeneic stem cell transplant. It's the only potential cure. The procedure is usually done if you're young and don't have any medical issues besides CML. It replaces abnormal white blood cells with stem cells you get from a donor and lets your body make healthy blood cells. But there are serious risks, including a disease called GVHD (graft-versus-host disease). When this happens, the new stem cells attack your normal cells by mistake. If other treatments don't work, an experimental drug may be an option. Researchers test new therapies in clinical trials, which could give you access to cutting-edge treatment not yet available to the general public.

Compared with most other respiratory infections, such as the common cold, the flu often causes a more severe illness. Typical flu symptoms include fever (usually 100-103 degrees Fahrenheit in adults and often even higher in children) and respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, as well as headache, muscle aches, and often extreme fatigue. Although nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can sometimes accompany the flu, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rare. The term \"stomach flu\" isn't really a flu at all. It's often used to describe an illness caused by other viruses. Most people who get the flu recover completely in one to two weeks, but some people develop serious and potentially life-threatening medical complications, such as pneumonia. Because each flu season is different in length and severity, the number of serious illnesses and deaths that occur each year varies. In the past 30 years, the annual death rate from flu-related causes has ranged from 3,000 to 49,000 deaths per year. Flu-related complications can occur at any age; however, very young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with chronic health problems are much more likely to develop serious complications of the flu than are younger, healthier people. Flu viruses are divided into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter and are often associated with increased rates for hospitalization and death. Influenza type C differs from types A and B in some important ways. Type C infection usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public health impact that influenza types A and B do. Efforts to control the impact of the flu are aimed at types A and B, and the remainder of this discussion will be devoted only to these two types. Flu viruses continually change over time. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the immune system, so that people are susceptible to the flu throughout life. This process works as follows: a person infected with a flu virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the virus changes, the \"older\" antibodies no longer recognizes the \"newer\" virus, and the person gets sick. The older antibodies can, however, provide partial protection against newer viruses. Influenza A and B viruses continually undergo a type of change called antigenic drift. This process accounts for most of the changes that occur in the viruses from one influenza season to another. Another change -- called antigenic shift -- occurs only occasionally. When it does occur, large numbers of people, and sometimes the entire population, have no antibody protection against the virus. This may result in a worldwide epidemic, called a pandemic. During the last century, major pandemics occurred three times, each of which resulted in large numbers of deaths: 1918-19 \" Spanish flu\" A -- Caused the highest known influenza-related mortality: approximately 500,000 deaths occurred in the U.

Eye irritation, nasal congestion, and/or runny nose may also be present. As stated previously, this can be allergy-related or an irritant reaction from exposure to asthma triggers in the workplace. If you think you have occupational asthma, ask your health care provider about a referral to an asthma specialist. The specialist will perform a detailed exam, including taking your past medical history and reviewing current breathing problems. After any necessary asthma tests, the specialist will develop an asthma treatment plan, which will include asthma medications, such as bronchodilators, asthma inhalers, and inhaled steroids to control your asthma. It will also be important to avoid any asthma triggers at work. Preventing asthma symptoms by reducing exposure to the triggers at work is the most important step you can take to reduce the occurrence of occupational asthma. It's also important to use appropriate asthma medication to prevent symptoms. Even with the right asthma medications, continued exposure at work can make asthma more difficult to control. OSHA (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) is a government agency that has created guidelines that determine acceptable levels of exposure to substances that may cause asthma. Employers are required to follow these rules.

Normal blood pressure is below 120/80. A person with malignant hypertension has a blood pressure that's typically above 180/120. Malignant hypertension should be treated as a medical emergency. In many people, high blood pressure is the main cause of malignant hypertension. Missing doses of blood pressure medications can also cause it. In addition, there are certain medical conditions that can cause it. They include: Collagen vascular disease, such as scleroderma Kidney disease Spinal cord injuries Tumor of the adrenal gland Use of certain medications, including birth control pills and MAOIs Use of illegal drugs, such as cocaine Malignant hypertension is rare. About 1% of people who have a history of high blood pressure develop this life-threatening condition. You are at greater risk of developing it if you are a man, African- American, or someone of lower economic status. Poor access to health care increases the risk. The main symptoms of malignant hypertension are a rapidly increasing blood pressure of 180/120 or higher and signs of organ damage. Usually, the damage happens to the kidneys or the eyes. Other symptoms depend on how the rise in blood pressure affects your organs. A common symptom is bleeding and swelling in the tiny blood vessels in the retina. The retina is the layer of nerves that line the back of the eye. It senses light and sends signals to the brain through the optic nerve, which can also be affected by malignant hypertension. When the eye is involved, malignant hypertension can cause changes in vision. Other symptoms of malignant hypertension include: Blurred vision Chest pain (angina) Difficulty breathing Dizziness Numbness in the arms, legs, and face Severe headache Shortness of breath In rare cases, malignant hypertension can cause brain swelling, which leads to a dangerous condition called hypertensive encephalopathy. Symptoms include: Blindness Changes in mental status Coma Confusion Drowsiness Headache that continues to get worse Nausea and vomiting Seizures High blood pressure, in general, makes it difficult for kidneys to filter wastes and toxins from the blood. It is a leading cause of kidney failure. Malignant hypertension can cause your kidneys to suddenly stop working properly. A diagnosis of malignant hypertension is based on blood pressure readings and signs of acute organ damage. If you have symptoms of malignant hypertension, the doctor will: Recheck your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs for abnormal sounds Examine your eyes to check for damage to the blood vessels of the retina and swelling of the optic nerve Order blood and urine tests that may include: Blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) and creatinine levels, which increase if you have kidney damage Blood clotting tests Blood sugar (glucose) level Complete blood count Sodium and potassium levels Urinalysis to check for blood, protein, or abnormal hormone levels related to kidney problems Additional blood tests may be needed, depending on the result of the tests listed above. The doctor will also ask for imaging tests, including: Echocardiogram to check heart function and blood flow through the heart Electrocardiogram ( ECG) to check the heart's electrical function Chest X-ray to look at the shape and size of the heart structures and to detect fluid in the lungs Other imaging tests to evaluate the kidneys and their arteries Malignant hypertension is a medical emergency and needs to be treated in a hospital, often in an intensive care unit. The doctor will consider your symptoms and overall health when deciding what treatment plan is best for you. The goal of treatment is to carefully lower your blood pressure within a matter of minutes. You will receive blood pressure medicines through an IV, which is the quickest way to treat extremely high blood pressure. Once blood pressure is at a safe level, the medications may be switched to oral forms. If you develop kidney failure, you may need kidney dialysis. Other treatments depend on your specific symptoms and possible causes of the malignant hypertension. Untreated, malignant hypertension causes death.

S. diagnosed each year with some type of the disease. Cancer occurs when normal cells undergo a transformation and grow and multiply without normal controls. Here are the cancer basics: As the cells multiply, they form a mass called a tumor. Tumors are cancerous only if they are malignant. This means that they encroach on and invade neighboring tissues (especially lymph nodes) because of their uncontrolled growth. Tumors may also travel to remote organs via the bloodstream. This process of invading and spreading to other organs is called metastasis. Tumors overwhelm surrounding tissues by invading their space and taking the oxygen and nutrients they need to survive and function. There are three major types of skin cancers: basal cell carcinoma ( BCC), squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC), and melanoma. The first two skin cancers are grouped together as non-melanoma skin cancers. Other unusual types of skin cancer include Merkel cell tumors and dermatofibrosarcoma protruberans. Here are the basics on skin cancers: The vast majority of skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas and squamous cells carcinomas. While malignant, these are unlikely to spread to other parts of the body. They may be locally disfiguring if not treated early. A small but significant number of skin cancers are malignant melanomas. Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer that tends to spread to other parts of the body. These cancers may be fatal if not treated early. Like many cancers, skin cancers start as precancerous lesions. These precancerous lesions are changes in skin that are not cancer, but could become cancer over time. Medical professionals often refer to these changes as dysplasia. Some specific dysplastic changes that occur in skin are as follows: Actinic keratosis is an area of red or brown, scaly, rough skin, which can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. A nevus is a mole, and abnormal moles are called dysplastic nevi. These can potentially develop into melanoma over time. Moles are simply growths on the skin that rarely develop into cancer. Most people have 10 to 30 moles on their body that can be identified as flat or raised, smooth on the surface, round or oval in shape, pink, tan, brown or skin-colored, and no larger than a quarter-inch across. If a mole on your body looks different from the others, ask your health care provider to take a look at it. Dysplastic nevi, or abnormal moles, are not cancer, but they can become cancer. People sometimes have as many as 100 or more dysplastic nevi, which are usually irregular in shape, with notched or fading borders. Some may be flat or raised, and the surface may be smooth or rough (\"pebbly\"). They are often large, at a quarter-inch across or larger, and are typically of mixed color, including pink, red, tan, and brown. Recent studies show the number of skin cancer cases in the U. S. growing at an alarming rate. Fortunately, increased awareness on the part of Americans and their health care providers has resulted in earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes. Ultraviolet ( UV) light exposure, most commonly from sunlight, is overwhelmingly the most frequent cause of skin cancer. Other important causes of skin cancer include the following: Use of tanning booths Immunosuppression, or impairment of the immune system, which protects the body from germs or substances that cause an allergic reaction Exposure to unusually high levels of radiation, such as from X-rays Contact with certain chemicals, such as arsenic (miners, sheep shearers, and farmers) and hydrocarbons in tar, oils, and soot (which may cause squamous cell carcinoma) The following people are at the greatest risk of skin cancer: People with fair skin, especially types that freckle, sunburn easily, or become painful in the sun People with light (blond or red) hair and blue or green eyes Those with certain genetic disorders that deplete skin pigment , such as albinism and xeroderma pigmentosum (a disease in which DNA repair mechanisms, especially in response to ultraviolet light, is impaired) People who have already been treated for skin cancer People with numerous moles, unusual moles, or large moles that were present at birth People with close family members who have developed skin cancer People who had at least one severe sunburn early in life People with burns unrelated to sunburn People with indoor occupations and outdoor recreational habits Basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are more common in older people. Melanomas are one of the most common cancers in younger people, especially in people ages 25 to 29. The risk of melanoma rises with age. Skin cancer symptoms depend on the type of skin cancer that has developed. A basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) usually looks like a raised, smooth, pearly bump on the sun-exposed skin of the head, neck, or shoulders. Others signs include: Small blood vessels may be visible within the tumor. A central depression with crusting and bleeding (ulceration) frequently develops. A BCC often appears as a sore that does not heal. A squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) is commonly a well-defined, red, scaling, thickened bump on sun-exposed skin. It may ulcerate and bleed, and left untreated, may develop into a large mass. The majority of malignant or cancerous melanomas are brown-to-black pigmented lesions. Other signs of a cancerous melanoma include: A change in size, shape, color, or elevation of a mole The appearance of a new mole during adulthood, or new pain, itching, ulceration, or bleeding of an existing mole The following easy-to-remember guideline, \" ABCDE,\" is useful for identifying malignant melanoma: Asymmetry -- One side of the lesion does not look like the other. Border irregularity -- Margins may be notched or irregular. Color -- Melanomas are often a mixture of black, tan, brown, blue, red, or white. Diameter -- Cancerous lesions can be larger than 6 mm across (about the size of a pencil eraser), although with early detection they will not reach this size. Evolution -- has a mole changed over time? Many people, especially those who have fair coloring or have had extensive sun exposure, periodically check their entire body for suspicious moles and lesions. Have your primary health care provider or a dermatologist check any moles or spots that concern you. See your health care provider to check your skin if you notice any changes in the size, shape, color, or texture of pigmented areas (such as darker or a change in areas of skin or moles). If you have skin cancer, your skin specialist (dermatologist) or cancer specialist (oncologist) will talk to you about symptoms of metastatic disease that might require care in a hospital. If you think a mole or other skin lesion has turned into skin cancer, your primary care provider will probably refer you to a dermatologist. The dermatologist will examine any moles in question and, in many cases, the entire skin surface. Any lesions that are difficult to identify, or are thought to be skin cancer, may then be checked. Tests for skin cancer may include: The doctor may use a handheld device called a dermatoscope to scan the lesion. Another handheld device, Mala Find, scans the lesion then a computer program evaluates images of the lesion to indicate if it's cancerous. A sample of skin (biopsy) will be taken so that the suspicious area of skin can be examined under a microscope. A biopsy is done in the dermatologist's office. If a biopsy shows that you have malignant melanoma, you may undergo further testing to determine the extent of spread of the disease, if any. This may involve blood tests, a chest X-ray, and other tests as needed. This is only needed if the melanoma is of a certain size. Skin cancer treatment for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is straightforward. Usually, surgical removal of the lesion is adequate. Malignant melanoma, however, may require several treatment methods -- depending on the size of the tumor -- including surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Because of the complexity of treatment decisions, people with malignant melanoma may benefit from the combined expertise of the dermatologist, a cancer surgeon, and an oncologist. Home treatment is not appropriate for skin cancer. These conditions require the care of a dermatologist or specialist in skin cancers. Be active in preventing and detecting skin cancer on yourself and others. Perform regular self-examinations of your skin and note any changes. Surgical removal is the mainstay of skin cancer treatment for both basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. For more information, see Surgery. People who cannot undergo surgery may be treated by external radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is the use of a small beam of radiation targeted at the skin lesion. The radiation kills the abnormal cells and destroys the lesion. Radiation therapy can cause irritation or burning of the surrounding normal skin. It can also cause fatigue. These side effects are temporary. In addition, a topical chemotherapy creams have been FDA approved for the treatment of certain low-risk nonmelanoma skin cancers. Patients with advanced or many basal cell carcinomas are sometimes prescribed oral pills to block the growth of these cancers. Side effects include muscle spasms, hair loss, taste changes, weight loss and fatigue. In advanced cases of melanoma, immune therapies, vaccines, or chemotherapy may be used. These treatments are typically offered as clinical trials. Clinical trials are studies of new therapies to see if they can be tolerated and work better than existing therapies. Small skin cancer lesions may be removed through a variety of techniques, including simple excision (cutting it away), electrodesiccation and curettage (scraping the tumor and then burning the tissue with an electric needle), and cryosurgery (freezing the area with liquid nitrogen). Larger tumors, lesions in high-risk locations, recurrent tumors, and lesions in cosmetically sensitive areas are removed by a technique called Mohs micrographic surgery. For this technique, the surgeon carefully removes tissue, layer by layer, until cancer-free tissue is reached. Malignant melanoma is treated more aggressively than just surgical removal. To ensure the complete removal of this dangerous malignancy, 1-2 cm of normal-appearing skin surrounding the tumor is also removed. Depending on the thickness of the melanoma, neighboring lymph nodes may also be removed and tested for cancer. The sentinel lymph node biopsy method uses a mildly radioactive substance to identify which lymph nodes are most likely to be affected. Most skin cancer is cured surgically in the dermatologist's office. Of skin cancers that do recur, most do so within three years. Therefore, follow up with your dermatologist as recommended. Make an appointment immediately if you suspect a problem. If you have advanced malignant melanoma, your oncologist may want to see you every few months. These visits may include total body skin exams, regional lymph node checks, and periodic chest X-rays and body scans. Over time, the intervals between follow-up appointments will increase. Eventually these checks may be done only once a year. You can reduce your risk of getting skin cancer by following these guidelines: Limit sun exposure. Attempt to avoid the sun's intense rays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Apply sunscreen every day. Use a sunscreen with sun protection factor ( SPF) of at least 30 both before and every 60 to 80 minutes during outdoor exposure. Select products that filter both UVA and UVB light. The label will tell you. If you are likely to sunburn, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants and a wide-brimmed hat. Avoid artificial tanning booths. Conduct monthly self-exams. Skin Self- Exams Monthly skin self-exams improve your chances of finding a skin cancer early, when it has done a minimum of damage to your skin and can be treated easily. Regular self-exams help you recognize any new or changing features. The best time to do a self-exam is right after a shower or bath. Do the self-exam in a bright room; use a full-length mirror and a hand-held mirror. Learn where your moles, birthmarks, and blemishes are, and what they look like. Each time you do a self-exam, check these areas for changes in size, texture, and color, and for ulceration. If you notice any changes, call your primary care provider or dermatologist. Check all areas of your body, including \"hard-to-reach\" areas. Ask a loved one to help you check if there are areas you can't see. Look in the full-length mirror at your front and your back (use the hand-held mirror to do this). Raise your arms and look at your left and right sides. Bend your elbows and look carefully at your palms, nails, forearms (front and back), and upper arms. Examine the backs and fronts of your legs. Look at your buttocks (including the area between the buttocks) and your genitals (use the hand-held mirror to make sure you see all skin areas). Sit down and examine your feet carefully, including the nails, soles and between the toes. Look at your scalp, face, and neck. You may use a comb or blow dryer to move your hair while examining your scalp. You may also enlist the help of a friend or family member. Although the number of skin cancers in the U. S. continues to rise, more skin cancers are being caught earlier, when they are easier to treat. Thus, illness and death rates have decreased. When treated properly, the cure rate for both basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) approaches 95%. The remaining cancers recur at some point after treatment. Recurrences of these cancers are almost always local (not spread elsewhere in the body), but they often cause significant tissue destruction. 2% of squamous cell carcinomas will eventually spread elsewhere in the body and turn into dangerous cancer. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually seen in people with compromised immune systems. In most cases, the outcome of malignant melanoma depends on the thickness of the tumor at the time of treatment. Thin lesions are almost always cured by simple surgery alone. Thicker tumors, which usually have been present for some time but have gone undetected, may spread to other organs. Surgery removes the tumor and any local spread, but it cannot remove distant metastasis. Other therapies, such as radiation therapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy, are used to treat the metastatic tumors. Malignant melanoma causes more than 75% of deaths from skin cancer. Almost 91,300 people are expected to be diagnosed with melanoma in the U. S. in 2018, and an estimated 12,000 people will die from some form of skin cancer the same year. Living with skin cancer presents many new challenges for you and for your family and friends. You will probably have many worries about how the cancer will affect you and your ability to \"live a normal life,\" that is, to care for your family and home, to hold your job, and to continue the friendships and activities you enjoy. Many people with a skin cancer diagnosis feel anxious and depressed. Some people feel angry and resentful; others feel helpless and defeated. For most people with skin cancer, talking about their feelings and concerns helps. Your friends and family members can be very supportive. They may be hesitant to offer support until they see how you are coping. Don't wait for them to bring it up. If you want to talk about your concerns, let them know. Some people don't want to \"burden\" their loved ones, or prefer talking about their concerns with a more neutral professional. A social worker, counselor, or member of the clergy can be helpful. Your dermatologist or oncologist should be able to recommend someone. Many people with cancer are profoundly helped by talking to other people who have cancer. Sharing your concerns with others who have been through the same thing can be remarkably reassuring. Support groups for people with cancer may be available through the medical center where you are receiving your treatment.

Many people with multiple sclerosis ( MS) have some form of tremor they can't control, in different parts of their bodies, like their head, arms, or legs. Intention tremor. There's no shaking when you're at rest. It starts when you try to reach or grasp something or move your hand or foot to a precise spot. This is the most common form of MS tremor, and it usually causes the most problems in day-to-day life. Postural tremors. You shake when you sit or stand, but not when you lie down. Resting tremor. You move more when you're sitting still and less when you move. This is more common with Parkinson's disease than MS. Nystagmus. This type causes jumpy eye movements. This disease damages the protective sheath (myelin) that covers the nerves in your brain and spinal cord. Tremors result from damage to a part of your brain called the cerebellum. It controls your balance and coordination and smooths out the actions that you make when you move your limbs and eyes or speak. These problems are one of the hardest MS symptoms to treat. There aren't any drugs made just to treat MS tremors. Your doctors will probably prescribe drugs for another condition, like: Acetazolamide ( Diamox), which treats a type of glaucoma and altitude sickness Buspirone ( Buspar) and clonazepam ( Klonopin), which are anti-anxiety drugs Hydroxyzine ( Atarax, Vistaril), an antihistamine Isoniazid ( INH), a drug for tuberculosis Primidone ( Mysoline), a seizure medicine Propranolol ( Inderal), which treats heart problems, high blood pressure, and migraines Braces: These can hold your joint still and stop extra movement. A brace on your ankle or foot can make it easier to walk. They can help control your arm, hand, or neck, too. Deep brain stimulation: This experimental approach is mostly used for people who have tremors from Parkinson's disease. A doctor implants electrodes into your brain. Wires connect them to a gadget in your chest. You use it to send your brain signals that stop the tremors. Medical cannabis: There's little evidence that cannabis can help with tremors, but study results are mixed and usually only include small numbers of people. Physical therapy: It can show you exercises that increase your range of motion, improve your posture and balance, and make your body more stable Speech therapy: If you have tremors in your lips, tongue, or jaw, a health professional can work with you to slow your speech, make it clearer, and control the volume. Occupational therapist: This person will set you up with special tools called adaptive or assistive devices. They can help you grab things from up high or off the floor, pull up a zipper, or hold a fork more easily. Weights: Adding extra weight to a body part can help keep it still. You can also add weights to commonly used items like forks, pencils, pens, eating utensils, canes, and walkers. Tremors can be tough to handle in social situations. You may feel like you want to be alone, but that can make you feel lonely and depressed.

These small clumps of cells that form on your colon lining are usually harmless. But some of them can lead to colon cancer. The most common types of colon polyps doctors remove are a type called tubular adenoma. It can become cancerous, and that danger goes up the bigger the polyps get. Sometimes cells in your body grow out of control, a process called mutation. Some of the abnormal cells can turn into polyps and other types of tumors. Tubular adenomas are often small -- less than 1/2 inch. Just like the name, they grow in a tube shape. You can get a less common but more serious type of polyps called villous adenomas. Instead of round or oval, they look shaggy, like a cauliflower. Some polyps combine the two growth patterns, and they're called tubulovillous adenomas. Almost all colon cancer starts out as polyps. They can grow slowly, over a decade or more. If you have tubular adenomas, they have about 4%-5% chance of becoming cancerous. The odds that villous adenomas will turn out to be dangerous are several times higher. You're more likely to get tubular adenomas if you are: 50 or older Obese Male From a family with history of colon polyps A couch potato You may not know you have tubular adenomas until your doctor finds them during a colonoscopy. But you may notice: Bleeding in your bottom Mucus in your poop Frequent diarrhea or constipation Belly cramps Anemia, from losing blood in your poop During a colonoscopy, your doctor inserts a long, flexible tube with a lens into your rectum and slowly threads it into your colon. She can see the images on a video monitor. Any tubular adenomas will show up as a lump sticking out from the lining of your colon. Your doctor will snip off the polyp or loop a wire around it and burn it off with electric current. You'll be asleep during the procedure, so you won't feel any pain. Your doctor will send the polyp to a lab. A pathologist will check it under a microscope to see how much the sample looks like cancer. No matter what the lab results say, the important thing is that all the polyps are out. If you've had tubular or any other types of adenomas, you'll need to have a follow-up colonoscopy to make sure they don't return. Usually, you'll need a repeat procedure every 3-5 years. But you may need one sooner if you had a lot of polyps, if they were big, or if your doctor was not able to remove them all. If you have a history of polyps in your colon, you're more likely to get colon cancer. Screening is your best way to prevent that. Doctors generally recommend getting your first colonoscopy at age 50. You may need to start at age 40 or earlier if someone in your family has had serious polyps or colon cancer. You also can take these steps to help avoid both colon polyps and colon cancer: Eat less fat and more vegetables, fresh fruits, and other high-fiber foods Keep your weight in a healthy range Avoid smoking and too much alcohol Talk to your doctors about pros and cons of taking an aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (such as ibuprofen) regularly.

Its main job is to store urine before it leaves your body. Your kidneys make pee. Tubes called ureters carry the pee from your kidneys to your bladder. When you use the bathroom, the muscles in your bladder push the urine out through a tube called the urethra. You get bladder cancer when bladder cells become abnormal and grow out of control. Over time, a tumor forms. It can spread to nearby lymph nodes and other organs. In severe cases, it can spread to distant parts of your body, including your bones, lungs, or liver. Bladder cancer is rare. It accounts for just 5% of all new cancers in the U. S. Doctors aren't sure. But they do know that several things increase your risk for the disease. They include: Genetic makeup, race, and family history. Bladder cancer is most common in white men over age 55. If you or someone in your immediate family (parents or siblings) has had cancer of the bladder or the urinary tract before, you're more likely to get it. Chronic bladder inflammation. If you have bladder infections that keep coming back or another condition that causes your bladder to be irritated for long periods of time, you stand a better chance of getting bladder cancer. Smoking . Every time you inhale tobacco fumes, you're taking in all kinds of harmful chemicals. Research shows that smoking is the cause of about 50% of all bladder cancers. Working around harmful chemicals. People who work in certain industries (painters, machinists, printers, hairdressers, and truck drivers, among others) may be exposed to harmful chemicals for long periods of time. This can increase their risk of disease. Taking certain diabetes medications. If you've taken pioglitazone ( Actos) for more than a year, you may stand a greater chance of getting bladder cancer. Other diabetes meds that contain pioglitazone ( Actoplus Met and Duetact) can also raise your risk. Prior chemo or radiation treatment. If you've had radiation therapy to your pelvis, you're more likely to develop bladder cancer. The same is true if you've taken the chemo medication cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan) for a long time. The 5-year survival rate for bladder cancer is about 77%. That means that about 7 out of 10 people who are diagnosed with the disease will still be alive 5 years later. But that's just an estimate.

With sleep apnea, your breathing while you are asleep is interrupted by repeated pauses known as apneic events. The types of sleep apnea include: obstructive sleep apnea, which is the most common form of sleep apnea; central sleep apnea; and mixed (or complex) sleep apnea, which combines the two other types. Sleep apnea can cause serious health problems. It can increase the risk for stroke, obesity, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, and high blood pressure. It may also increase the risk for accidents while working or driving, as some people with sleep apnea may fall asleep during those activities. In CSA, breathing is disrupted regularly during sleep because of the way the brain functions. It is not that you cannot breathe (which is true in obstructive sleep apnea); rather, you do not try to breathe at all. The brain does not tell your muscles to breathe. This type of sleep apnea is usually associated with serious illness, especially an illness in which the lower brainstem -- which controls breathing -- is affected. In infants, central sleep apnea produces pauses in breathing that can last 20 seconds. Central sleep apnea is more common among older adults, especially adults older than age 65. This could be because they may have other medical conditions or sleep patterns that are more likely to cause CSA. Another factor, is being male. Men are more at risk for both CSA and obstructive sleep apnea. Being overweight is a risk factors for OSA but is generally not considered a risk factor for CSA. However, anyone can have any of the types of sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is often associated with other conditions. One form of central sleep apnea, however, has no known cause and is not associated with any other disease. In addition, central sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea, or it can occur alone. Conditions that may be associated with central sleep apnea include the following: Congestive heart failure Hypothyroid Disease Kidney failure Neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) Damage to the brainstem caused by encephalitis, stroke, injury, or other factors The main symptom of CSA is temporary stoppages of breathing while asleep. Although snoring is a very strong symptom of obstructive sleep apnea, snoring is usually not found with central sleep apnea. Symptoms may also include: Being very tired during the day Waking up often during the night Having headaches in the early morning Poor memory and difficulty concentrating Mood problems If you have any of these symptoms of central sleep apnea, or if a family member or bed partner notices that you stop breathing while sleeping, you should talk to your doctor or health care provider. If your doctor suspects you have central sleep apnea, he is likely to perform a physical exam, take a medical history, and recommend a sleep history. The next step will likely be an overnight sleep study called a polysomnogram. This test is performed in a sleep lab under the direct supervision of a trained technologist. During the test, the following body functions may be monitored: Electrical activity of the brain Eye movements Muscle activity Heart rate Breathing patterns Air flow Blood oxygen levels After the study is completed, the technologist will tally the number of times that breathing is impaired during sleep and then grade the severity of sleep apnea. If CSA is associated with some other condition, such as congestive heart failure, that condition is treated, if possible. Some of the more conservative treatments for obstructive sleep apnea would likely benefit people with central sleep apnea as well. Some of these conservative treatments include: Losing weight if necessary, and then maintaining a healthy weight Avoiding the use of alcohol and sleeping pills, as these items make the airway more likely to collapse during sleep Sleeping on your side if you have apneic events when sleeping on your back, possibly using pillows or other devices to keep you in place Using nasal sprays or breathing strips to keep air flowing if you have sinus problems or nasal congestion Avoiding sleep deprivation Another treatment is continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP), which is the preferred initial treatment for most people with obstructive sleep apnea. The treatment has been beneficial in people with central sleep apnea, as well. This is especially true of people who have central sleep apnea associated with heart failure. With CPAP, patients wear a mask over their nose and/or mouth. An air blower forces air through the nose and/or mouth. The air pressure is adjusted so that it is just enough to prevent the upper airway tissues from collapsing during sleep. The pressure is constant and continuous. CPAP prevents airway closure while it is being used, but apnea episodes return when CPAP is stopped or is used improperly. Other styles and types of positive airway pressure devices are available for people who have difficulty tolerating CPAP. ASV ( Adaptive servo-ventilation) and BPAP ( Bilevel positive airway pressure) are other devices which deliver pressurized air. For patients with moderate to severe central sleep apnea, the FDA has recently approved an implantable device called the Remede System. The small machine is surgically placed under the skin in the upper chest area where it helps stimulate the nerve which moves your diaphragm when you breathe. It monitors your respiratory signals while you sleep and helps restore normal breathing patterns. Medications can be used under some circumstances.

But inflammatory bowel disease (commonly called IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (shortened to IBS) aren't the same. Both can cause stomach pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation. But that's where the similarities end. IBS and IBD have different causes and treatments. You can't tell which it is by how you feel, and you need to know the difference so you can get the right type of help. IBD is a structural disease. That means there is underlying physical damage that causes your symptoms. Doctors can see chronic inflammation or ulcers when they examine the gut with an X-ray, endoscopy, surgery, or biopsy. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases. IBS, on the other hand, is what doctors call a functional disease. Someone with this type of disease will have a group of symptoms, but tests won't show any physical explanation for those problems. Since IBD and IBS are both chronic conditions that affect the gut, they have some overlapping warning signs: belly pain and diarrhea. Plus, they both tend to be diagnosed in young people. IBS can also cause constipation, extra gas, nausea, or make you feel like you urgently need to have a bowel movement. But other symptoms are unique to IBD, caused by the inflammation in your gut. They include: Blood in your stools or black stools Weight loss or loss of appetite Progressively worsening symptoms Fever Inflammation in the skin, joints, or eyes If you notice these red flags, your doctor will likely suspect that you have IBD or another structural disease -- not IBS. Doctors use something called the â Rome criteriaâ to decide if you have irritable bowel syndrome. According to the criteria, you may be diagnosed with IBS if you have belly pain for at least 1 day a week for the previous 3 months. The pain must also meet at least two of the following: It is associated with a bowel movement. When it starts, you begin to have bowel movements more or less often. Your stools look different when it begins. In some cases, doctors will diagnose you with IBS just using these standards. But in many cases, especially if you also have other symptoms that hint at IBD, you'll get tests to find out whether there's any bleeding or inflammation in your digestive tract. If there is, then you don't have IBS. Since it's a structural disease, a doctor needs to find physical damage in your gut to make the diagnosis. To look for inflammation, ulcers, and bleeding, you may get: Tests of your blood and stools A colonoscopy or other imaging tests to look inside your gut, with a biopsy CT scans If you have inflammation and ulcers, your doctor can use these tests to narrow down what form of IBD you have. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two main types. Doctors understand better what causes the two conditions, since they have physical signs to help them. The long-lasting inflammation in the digestive tracts of people with IBD can cause bleeding and ulcers (sores). In turn, this irritation causes pain and, by aggravating the immune system, leads to symptoms like fever and fatigue. The causes of IBS aren't as clear. Scientists have found links between irritable bowel syndrome and the immune system, and how muscles move food through the gut. Many people have certain triggers that cause their symptoms to get worse, including some foods, stress, infections, and hormonal changes. People with IBS often try to treat it by changing what they eat. There is no specific diet that works for everyone who has the condition. But you could ask your doctor if it would help to: Get more fiber (from food or supplements). Stop lactose, which is in dairy products. Cut down on foods that make you gassy or bloated. Get more water. ( You can drink it or eat H2 O-rich foods.) Avoid caffeine and legumes (beans). Limit or avoid â FODMAPsâ (a certain type of sugar found in some fruit, vegetable, bread and dairy products). Your doctor may also prescribe drugs to help with diarrhea or constipation if you need more relief. Other things that can help include stress management, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, and relaxation training. Researchers are also studying whether probiotics help tame IBS. Counseling is also helpful, especially if the stress of having the condition starts to get to you, or if you notice you're limiting your social life because you worry about when your symptoms will affect you. A support group is another great resource, because the people there will understand, from personal experience, what it's like to have IBS. IBD, on the other hand, is more often treated with drugs that target the inflammation that causes symptoms. These powerful meds generally don't work as a treatment for IBS, which is one reason why it's so important to know which condition you have. And while some people with IBD need surgery to repair the physical damage to their digestive tract, surgery isn't needed for IBS.

Irritable bowel syndrome doesn't do that, but you should still keep up with your regularly scheduled screening tests.", "question": "Is IBS or IBD related to colorectal cancer?", "answer": ["Lastly, an inflammatory bowel disease makes you more likely to get colorectal cancer.
