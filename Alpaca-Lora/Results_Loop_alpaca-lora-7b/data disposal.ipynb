      "'MRSA is spread by contact. So, you could get MRSA by touching another person who has it on the skin. Or you could get it by touching objects that have the bacteria on them. MRSA infections are common among people who have weak immune systems who are in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care centers. Infections can appear around surgical wounds or invasive devices, like catheters or implanted feeding tubes. According to the CDC, invasive MRSA infections that began in hospitals declined 8% between 2011 and 2013. Community- Associated MRSA ( CA- MRSA) Alarmingly, MRSA is also showing up in healthy people who have not been hospitalized. This type of MRSA is called community-associated MRSA, or CA- MRSA. CA- MRSA skin infections have been identified among certain populations that share close quarters or have more skin-to-skin contact. Examples are team athletes, military recruits, prison inmates, and children in daycare. But more and more CA- MRSA infections are being seen in the general community, especially in certain geographic regions. CA- MRSA is also more likely to affect younger people. In a study of Minnesotans published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, the average age of people with MRSA in a hospital or health care facility was 68. But the average age of a person with CA- MRSA was only 23.\n",

Water is important for your digestion. It keeps the food you eat moving through your intestines, and it keeps your intestines smooth and flexible, too. Dehydration is one of the most common causes of chronic constipation. The food you eat makes its way from your stomach to the large intestine, or colon. If you don\\'t have enough water in your body already, the large intestine soaks up water from your food waste. This makes you have hard stools that are difficult to pass. There are other causes of chronic constipation too, including what you eat, traveling, medicines, irritable bowel syndrome, and pregnancy. Watch the amount of fluid you drink, listen to your body, and drink more liquids during exercise and hot weather. You get dehydrated when your body gets rid of more fluids than it takes in. Extra fluids help keep the stool soft and easy to pass, but drinking more liquids does not cure constipation. In general, for healthy, average people, 8 cups a day is a good goal. Talk to your doctor about how much water is good for you. People with some medical conditions may need to drink less than that. Others may need more than 8 cups a day. Fruit and vegetable juices, clear soups, and herbal teas are also good sources of fluids. Stay away from alcohol. It is a diuretic, which gets rid of water from your body and leads to dehydration.

      "'Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Symptoms of influenza include fever, chills, body aches, fatigue, headache, sore throat, and cough.

The symptoms of influenza include fever (usually 100-103 degrees Fahrenheit in adults and often even higher in children), and respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, as well as headache, muscle aches, and often extreme fatigue. Flu viruses are divided into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter and are often associated with increased rates for hospitalization and death. Influenza type C differs from types A and B in some important ways. Type C infection usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public health impact that influenza types A and B do. Efforts to control the impact of the flu are aimed at types A and B, and the remainder of this discussion will be devoted only to these two types. Flu viruses continually change over time. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the immune system, so that people are susceptible to the flu throughout life. This process works as follows: a person infected with a flu virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the virus changes, the \"older\" antibodies no longer recognizes the \"newer\" virus, and the person gets sick. The older antibodies can, however, provide partial protection against newer viruses. Influenza A and B viruses continually undergo a type of change called antigenic drift. This process accounts for most of the changes that occur in the viruses from one influenza season to another. Another change -- called antigenic shift -- occurs only occasionally. When it does occur, large numbers of people, and sometimes the entire population, about  you just made.\n",

Any tubular adenomas will show up as a lump sticking out from the lining of your colon. Your doctor will snip off the polyp or loop a wire around it and burn it off with electric current. You'll be asleep during the procedure, so you won't feel any pain. Your doctor will send the polyp to a lab. A pathologist will check it under a microscope to see how much the sample looks like cancer. No matter what the lab results say, the important thing is that all the polyps are out. If you've had tubular or any other types of adenomas, you'll need to have a follow-up colonoscopy to make sure they don't return. Usually, you'll need a repeat procedure every 3-5 years. But you may need one sooner if you had a lot of polyps, if they were big, or if your doctor was not able to remove them all. If you have a history of polyps in your colon, you're more likely to get colon cancer. Screening is your best way to prevent that. Doctors generally recommend getting your first colonoscopy at age 50. You may need to start at age 40 or earlier if someone in your family has had serious polyps or colon cancer. You also can take these steps to help avoid both colon polyps and colon cancer: eat less fat and more vegetables, fresh fruits, and other high-fiber foods; keep your weight in a healthy range; avoid smoking and too much alcohol; talk to your doctors about pros and cons of taking an aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (such as ibuprofen) regularly.
