'MRSA is spread by contact. So, you could get MRSA by touching another person who has it on the skin. Or you could get it by touching objects that have the bacteria on them. MRSA infections are common among people who have weak immune systems who are in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care centers. Infections can appear around surgical wounds or invasive devices, like catheters or implanted feeding tubes. According to the CDC, invasive MRSA infections that began in hospitals declined 8% between 2011 and 2013. Community- Associated MRSA ( CA- MRSA) Alarmingly, MRSA is also showing up in healthy people who have not been hospitalized. This type of MRSA is called community-associated MRSA, or CA- MRSA. CA- MRSA skin infections have been identified among certain populations that share close quarters or have more skin-to-skin contact. Examples are team athletes, military recruits, prison inmates, and children in daycare. But more and more CA- MRSA infections are being seen in the general community, especially in certain geographic regions. CA- MRSA is also more likely to affect younger people. In a study of Minnesotans published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, the average age of people with MRSA in a hospital or health care facility was 68. But the average age of a person with CA- MRSA was only 23.

'Dysplastic nevi mole is a type of melanoma that is characterized by abnormal growth of melanocytes. It is a rare form of melanoma that is usually found in the skin. It is usually diagnosed by a biopsy and is treated with surgery. Dysplastic nevi are moles that are generally larger than average (larger than a pencil eraser) and irregular in shape. They tend to have uneven color with dark brown centers and lighter, uneven edges. These nevi are somewhat more likely to become melanoma (cancer) than are moles that appear after birth. Any changes in a mole should be checked if it has a diameter of more than a pencil eraser or any characteristics of the ABCDEs of melanoma (see below).
'Common skin lesions include moles, freckles, lentigines, seborrheic keratoses, and melanoma. Moles are dark spots on the skin that are usually harmless. Freckles are small, light-colored spots on the skin that are usually harmless. Lentigines are flat, brown spots on the skin that are usually harmless. Seborrheic keratoses are small, rough growths on the skin caused by a virus. Skin tags are small, soft, and flesh-colored growths on the skin. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be caused by too much exposure to the sun.
'Mucositis is a side effect of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. It is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes in the mouth, throat, and stomach.

'Doctors use a variety of tools to diagnose eye pain. These include eye drops, eye ointments, and eye patches. They may also use a slit lamp to examine the eye more closely. The slit lamp is a special microscope that allows doctors to examine the eye in great detail. It can be used to diagnose a variety of eye conditions, such as glaucoma, cataracts, and corneal abrasions. Additionally, doctors may use a tonometer to measure the pressure inside the eye. This can help diagnose glaucoma, a condition that causes increased pressure inside the eye. Finally, doctors may prescribe antibacterial, antiviral, and antibiotic eyedrops to treat eye pain. These drops can help reduce inflammation and prevent infection.
'Dehydration can be prevented by drinking plenty of fluids, especially when exercising or in hot weather. It is also important to eat a balanced diet, which includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. Staying well-hydrated can be a key part of your plan to "get things moving" again. Water is important for your digestion. It keeps the food you eat moving through your intestines, and it keeps your intestines smooth and flexible, too. Dehydration is one of the most common causes of chronic constipation. The food you eat makes its way from your stomach to the large intestine, or colon. If you don\'t have enough water in your body already, the large intestine soaks up water from your food waste. This makes you have hard stools that are difficult to pass. There are other causes of chronic constipation too, including what you eat, traveling, medicines, irritable bowel syndrome, and pregnancy. Watch the amount of fluid you drink, listen to your body, and drink more liquids during exercise and hot weather. You get dehydrated when your body gets rid of more fluids than it takes in. Extra fluids help keep the stool soft and easy to pass, but drinking more liquids does not cure constipation. In general, for healthy, average people, 8 cups a day is a good goal. Talk to your doctor about how much water is good for you. People with some medical conditions may need to drink less than that. Others may need more than 8 cups a day. Fruit and vegetable juices, clear soups, and herbal teas are also good sources of fluids. Stay away from alcohol. It is a diuretic, which gets rid of water from your body and leads to dehydration. Caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, and colas are also diuretics, but as long as you drink moderate amounts, they probably won\'t cause dehydration.
"Allogeneic stem cell transplant is a procedure that replaces abnormal white blood cells with stem cells you get from a donor and lets your body make healthy blood cells. It is the only potential cure for chronic myelogenous leukemia. The donor stem cells are matched to the patient's stem cells and are transplanted into the patient. The donor stem cells then take over the production of blood cells in the patient, replacing the unhealthy stem cells. This helps to reduce the number of unhealthy stem cells in the patient and can help to control the growth of the leukemia.
'Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Symptoms of influenza include fever, chills, body aches, fatigue, headache, sore throat, and cough. Other symptoms may include runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. The symptoms of influenza include fever (usually 100-103 degrees Fahrenheit in adults and often even higher in children), and respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, as well as headache, muscle aches, and often extreme fatigue. Flu viruses are divided into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter and are often associated with increased rates for hospitalization and death. Influenza type C differs from types A and B in some important ways. Type C infection usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public health impact that influenza types A and B do. Efforts to control the impact of the flu are aimed at types A and B, and the remainder of this discussion will be devoted only to these two types. Flu viruses continually change over time. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the immune system, so that people are susceptible to the flu throughout life. This process works as follows: a person infected with a flu virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the virus changes, the "older" antibodies no longer recognizes the "newer" virus, and the person gets sick. The older antibodies can, however, provide partial protection against newer viruses. Influenza A and B viruses continually undergo a type of change called antigenic drift. This process accounts for most of the changes that occur in the viruses from one influenza season to another. Another change -- called antigenic shift -- occurs only occasionally. When it does occur, large numbers of people, and sometimes the entire population, about  you just made.
'Occupational asthma can be caused by a variety of substances, including latex, animal dander, grains, metals, and chemicals. Latex can cause occupational asthma in healthcare workers, such as nurses and doctors, who are exposed to latex gloves. Animal dander can cause occupational asthma in veterinarians, animal handlers, and animal breeders. Grains can cause occupational asthma in farmers, grain handlers, and grain mill workers. Metals can cause occupational asthma in workers who are exposed to fumes, vapors, and gases from welding, soldering, and brazing. Chemicals can cause occupational asthma in workers who are exposed to vapors, fumes, and gases from cleaning products, paints, and solvents.
"A doctor will use imaging tests to check for malignant hypertension. These tests may include: Echocardiogram to check heart function and blood flow through the heart Electrocardiogram ( ECG) to check the heart's electrical function Chest X-ray to look at the shape and size of the heart structures and to detect fluid in the lungs Other imaging tests to evaluate the kidneys and their arteries.
'Yes, it is important to have a plan for your daily activities if you have rheumatoid arthritis. Having a plan can help you to organize your tasks and activities in a way that is easier to manage. It can also help you to prioritize tasks and activities that are important to you.
'Other important causes of skin cancer include genetic predisposition, immunosuppression, and chronic sun exposure. Genetic predisposition is a risk factor for skin cancer, as it increases the likelihood of developing the disease. Immunosuppression is a condition in which the immune system is weakened, making it more difficult for the body to fight off cancerous cells. Chronic sun exposure is a major cause of skin cancer, as it increases the risk of developing the disease.
"A bone biopsy is usually done in a hospital or doctor's office. You will be awake during the procedure. The patient will be given medication to help them relax. The sample is then examined under a microscope to look for signs of disease or abnormalities.
'Bone biopsy results will tell you the type of bone disease you have, the extent of the disease, and the best treatment options. The results of a bone biopsy can tell you whether you have a tumor in your bone, and if that tumor is cancer. This information can help you and your doctor decide on the best treatment options.
"There are several drugs that can help with tremors caused by MS. Beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, and antispastic agents can all be used to treat tremors. Beta-blockers are used to treat tremors caused by Parkinson's disease. Anticonvulsants are used to treat tremors caused by epilepsy. Antispastic agents are used to treat tremors caused by spasticity. Acetazolamide ( Diamox), which treats a type of glaucoma and altitude sickness, can also be used to treat tremors caused by MS. Buspirone ( Buspar) and clonazepam ( Klonopin), which are anti-anxiety drugs, can also be used to treat tremors caused by MS. Hydroxyzine ( Atarax, Vistaril), an antihistamine, can also be used to treat tremors caused by MS. Isoniazid ( INH), a drug for tuberculosis, can also be used to treat tremors caused by MS. Primidone ( Mysoline), a seizure medicine, can also be used to treat tremors caused by MS. Braces: These can hold your joint still and stop extra movement. A brace on your ankle or foot can make it easier to walk. They can help control your arm, hand, or neck, too. Deep brain stimulation: This experimental approach is mostly used for people who have tremors from Parkinson's disease. A doctor implants electrodes into your brain. Wires connect them to a gadget in your chest. You use it to send your brain signals that stop the tremors. Medical cannabis: There's little evidence that cannabis can help with tremors, but study results are mixed and usually only include small numbers of people. Physical therapy: It can show you exercises that increase your range of motion, improve your posture and balance, and make your body more stable Speech therapy: If you have tremors in your lips, tongue, or jaw, a health professional can work with you to slow your speech, make it clearer, and control the volume. Occupational therapist: This person will set you up with special tools called adaptive or assistive devices. They can help you grab things from up high or off the floor, pull up a zipper,
"Symptoms of tubular adenomas include: bleeding in the bottom, mucus in the poop, frequent diarrhea or constipation, belly cramps, anemia, from losing blood in the poop. During a colonoscopy, your doctor inserts a long, flexible tube with a lens into your rectum and slowly threads it into your colon. She can see the images on a video monitor. Any tubular adenomas will show up as a lump sticking out from the lining of your colon. Your doctor will snip off the polyp or loop a wire around it and burn it off with electric current. You'll be asleep during the procedure, so you won't feel any pain. Your doctor will send the polyp to a lab. A pathologist will check it under a microscope to see how much the sample looks like cancer. No matter what the lab results say, the important thing is that all the polyps are out. If you've had tubular or any other types of adenomas, you'll need to have a follow-up colonoscopy to make sure they don't return. Usually, you'll need a repeat procedure every 3-5 years. But you may need one sooner if you had a lot of polyps, if they were big, or if your doctor was not able to remove them all. If you have a history of polyps in your colon, you're more likely to get colon cancer. Screening is your best way to prevent that. Doctors generally recommend getting your first colonoscopy at age 50. You may need to start at age 40 or earlier if someone in your family has had serious polyps or colon cancer. You also can take these steps to help avoid both colon polyps and colon cancer: eat less fat and more vegetables, fresh fruits, and other high-fiber foods; keep your weight in a healthy range; avoid smoking and too much alcohol; talk to your doctors about pros and cons of taking an aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (such as ibuprofen) regularly. It may help protect again colon cancer.
'Smoking can cause bladder cancer by increasing the risk of developing bladder inflammation. Bladder inflammation is a risk factor for bladder cancer, and smoking can increase the risk of developing this condition. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can damage the cells in the bladder, leading to cancer.
'The most common symptom of central sleep apnea is excessive daytime sleepiness. Other symptoms may include: being very tired during the day, waking up often during the night, sleeping on your side if you have apnea episodes when sleeping on your back, possibly using nasal sprays or breathing strips to prevent airway closure. ASV (Adaptive servo-ventilation) and BPAP (Bilevel positive airway pressure) are other devices which deliver pressurized air. For patients with moderate to severe central sleep apnea, the FDA has recently approved an implantable device called the Remede System. The small machine is surgically placed under the skin in the upper chest area where it helps stimulate the nerve which moves your diaphragm when you breathe. It monitors your respiratory signals while you sleep and helps restore normal breathing patterns. Medications can be used under some circumstances. Several different medications aimed at improving CSA include acetazolamide, theophylline, and sedative-hypnotic agents.
'No, IBS and IBD are not related to colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon and rectum. It is not related to IBS or IBD.
